#### Mechanisms Behind NIM and Triton Inference Server

NIM utilizes the Triton Inference Server as its core engine for managing and executing model inferences efficiently. Each NIM instance is encapsulated within a Docker container, simplifying deployment across diverse platforms and operating systems. Upon initialization, NIM evaluates the local hardware configuration to select the most optimized model version from the NVIDIA NGC Catalog, ensuring optimal performance tailored to available GPU resources.

For NVIDIA GPUs that support it, NIM employs the TRT-LLM library combined with optimized TensorRT engines to execute inferences. This combination enhances performance by leveraging GPU acceleration. For GPUs that do not support TRT-LLM, NIM defaults to using the vLLM library with non-optimized models, ensuring flexibility and consistent performance across different hardware setups.

Models are distributed as container images via the NVIDIA NGC Catalog, which includes comprehensive security scan reports detailing vulnerabilities and their severities. This approach not only streamlines the deployment process but also ensures security compliance and integrity of the models in operation.
