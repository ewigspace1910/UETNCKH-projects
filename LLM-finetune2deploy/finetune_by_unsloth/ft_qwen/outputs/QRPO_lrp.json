{"label": "Band score Lexical Resource: 9", "pred": "Based on the **Lexical Resource** rubric in the IELTS Speaking test, the evaluation focuses on **the range of vocabulary used and the accuracy with which it is used**. The candidate should demonstrate **a wide range of vocabulary** that is **accurate and appropriate** to the topic and task.\n\nHere is an **evaluation** of the answers under the **Lexical Resource** criterion:\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Lexical Resource Score: 6.5 (Band 6.5)**\n\n---\n\n### **Breakdown:**\n\n#### **Strengths (Positive Aspects):**\n1. **Use of Appropriate Vocabulary:**\n   - The candidate uses a variety of vocabulary related to place, school trips, and fashion.\n   - Phrases such as *\"coolest neighborhood,\" \"quiet environment,\" \"well-organized,\" \"trendy people,\" \"designer boutiques,\" \"interesting clothes,\" \"simple dress\"* show a reasonable range of vocabulary for each topic.\n\n2. **Some Use of Adjectives and Adverbs:**\n   - Words like *\"magnificent,\" \"quiet,\" \"very well organized,\" \"great people,\" \"enforced,\" \"definitely,\" \"absolutely\"* demonstrate an attempt to use descriptive and modifying vocabulary.\n\n3. **Use of Prepositions and Basic Syntax:**\n   - The candidate uses correct prepositions such as *\"near your street,\" \"in the mountains,\" \"at the footstep of a mountain,\" \"without spending a lot of money.\"*\n\n4. **Topic-specific Vocabulary:**\n   - The answer on school trips includes vocabulary related to travel, such as *\"hike,\" \"mountains,\" \"equipment, instructions,\" \"leaders,\" \"abroad,\" \"schoolchildren.\"*\n\n---\n\n#### **Weaknesses (Areas for Improvement):**\n1. **Limited Range and Precision:**\n   - The vocabulary is somewhat **basic** and repetitive in some parts.\n   - Phrases like *\"um, uh, I think, I don't know\"* and filler words indicate that the candidate is not always precise or confident with vocabulary.\n\n2. **Occasional Errors and Inaccuracies:**\n   - Some errors occur:\n     - *\"at the footstep of a mountain\"* should be *\"at the foot of a mountain.\"*\n     - *\"I think that was like a common practice\"* is unclear and non-native in phrasing.\n     - *\"Three stores rule\"* is vague and lacks clarity or explanation. It appears to be a non-sequitur or an incomplete thought.\n\n3. **Limited Sophistication of Language:**\n   - The vocabulary used lacks **sophistication and nuance**. For example, *\"I think it's essential to move\"* could be more naturally phrased as *\"I think it\u2019s important to move\" or \"I think it\u2019s essential to relocate.\"*\n   - In the fashion section, *\"three stores rule\"* is unclear, and the explanation is vague and possibly incorrect.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Use of Collocations:**\n   - Phrases like *\"the coolest neighborhood,\" \"great leaders,\" \"interesting clothes\"* are generally correct, but the speaker occasionally uses less idiomatic or less idiomatic expressions (e.g., *\"get to the city center very quickly\"* instead of *\"access the city center quickly\"*).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe candidate demonstrates a **basic to intermediate range of vocabulary** with some topic-specific words. However, the use of vocabulary is sometimes **inaccurate or overly simplistic**, and **filler words** and **hesitations** reduce clarity and fluency.\n\n**Therefore, a score of 6.5** is appropriate for **Lexical Resource**, based on the **range and accuracy of vocabulary** used in the answers.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation for Improvement:**\n- Practice **more precise and idiomatic expressions** for describing places, trips, and fashion.\n- Focus on **expanding vocabulary range** with more **nuanced and sophisticated expressions**.\n- Minimize the use of **filler words** and hesitations to improve clarity.\n- Use **more collocations** and **natural phrasing** in speech (e.g., use *\"go abroad\"* instead of *\"take the schoolchildren abroad\"*).\n- Make sure that **each idea is clearly explained** with appropriate vocabulary and grammar."}

{"label": "Band score Lexical Resource: 3", "pred": "Based on the **\"Lexical Resource\"** rubric for the IELTS Speaking test, the focus is on the **range of vocabulary** used and the **accuracy** with which words and phrases are used. Let's evaluate the answers in terms of **lexical resource** for the three topics: **Home**, **Street Markets and Shops**, and **Voice**.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Topic: Home**\n\n#### **Answers:**\n- \"I live in a garage and my home is under.\"\n- \"There is a lot of many changes. I actually want to know first when I tell this. Maybe in kind of furniture and put it some another day.\"\n- \"I'm actually planning to move on another country. Yeah, maybe.\"\n\n#### **Lexical Resource Evaluation:**\n- **Vocabulary Range:** Very limited and repetitive vocabulary. Words like *home, change, move* are used but in unclear or incorrect contexts.\n- **Accuracy:** There are several grammatical errors and word choice mistakes. For example:\n  - *\"I live in a garage and my home is under.\"* \u2013 unclear, grammatically incorrect.\n  - *\"There is a lot of many changes\"* \u2013 incorrect use of \"a lot of\" and \"many\" together.\n  - *\"put it some another day\"* \u2013 incorrect phrasing (should be \"put it on another day\").\n  - *\"move on another country\"* \u2013 incorrect preposition use (should be \"move to another country\").\n- **Fluency and Coherence:** While not directly part of Lexical Resource, the vocabulary is not sufficient to express ideas clearly.\n\n**Score Estimation for Lexical Resource:** **3.5\u20134.0** (limited vocabulary, poor accuracy, unclear expression)\n\n---\n\n### **2. Topic: Street Markets and Shops**\n\n#### **Answers:**\n- \"Yeah, a lot of markets on there and I actually enjoy to be there every time. It's another my hobby.\"\n- \"Yeah, freely, actually in off day, they can move on there and go there.\"\n- \"A benefit is to be connected well and be always opening, you know, for me, actually, it's better for me, so I think that is.\"\n\n#### **Lexical Resource Evaluation:**\n- **Vocabulary Range:** Very basic, repetitive, and unclear. Use of phrases like *\"a lot of markets on there\"*, *\"another my hobby\"*, *\"move on there\"*, and *\"be always opening\"*, which are grammatically incorrect or awkward.\n- **Accuracy:** Many grammatical errors, unclear prepositions (e.g. \"on there\", \"move on there\"), misuse of tenses and vocabulary.\n- **Expression:** Ideas are not clearly communicated due to limited and incorrect word use.\n\n**Score Estimation for Lexical Resource:** **3.0\u20133.5** (very limited vocabulary, frequent errors, poor expression)\n\n---\n\n### **3. Topic: Voice**\n\n#### **Answers:**\n- \"Yeah, uh, I actually like to hear, uh, any kind of voices, you know, in any, uh, accent, maybe in British or American.\"\n- \"I'm sorry, I couldn't understand the speech. Could you please repeat it?\"\n- \"I haven't tried yet, but I think so.\"\n\n#### **Lexical Resource Evaluation:**\n- **Vocabulary Range:** Very limited and repetitive.\n- **Accuracy:** The responses are grammatically correct in some parts (e.g., *\"I couldn\u2019t understand the speech\"*) but others are hesitant, with fillers (\"uh\", \"you know\"), and vague expressions (*\"I think so\"*).\n- **Clarity:** The speaker struggles to provide a clear answer to the second question, indicating a lack of vocabulary or confidence.\n\n**Score Estimation for Lexical Resource:** **3.5\u20134.0** (limited vocabulary, some accurate phrases, but overall poor clarity and expression)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Lexical Resource Score Estimation:**\nTaking all three topics into account and the overall **CTTR (Cumulative Test Trait Rating): 5.254**, the **Lexical Resource** component likely falls around:\n\n> **Band 4.0**\n\nThis is consistent with the observed vocabulary limitations, grammatical errors, and inability to clearly and effectively express ideas. The speaker uses a very limited range of vocabulary and often makes incorrect or unclear word choices, which negatively affects the **Lexical Resource** score.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement:**\n- Expand vocabulary, especially in areas like describing places, personal preferences, and benefits or advantages.\n- Practice using more accurate and varied prepositions, articles, and collocations.\n- Reduce reliance on fillers like \u201cuh\u201d and \u201cyou know\u201d.\n- Use more specific vocabulary to avoid vague expressions like \u201cI think so\u201d or \u201cmaybe.\u201d\n- Focus on speaking fluently and clearly, even if it requires slowing down and thinking carefully about word choice."}

Yes, ten friends.\"*  \n   - **Evaluation:** Very basic vocabulary. Uses repetitive structure (\"Yes, I have... Yes, ten...\"). The answer is clear, but vocabulary is extremely limited. There is a repetition of \"yes,\" which is not appropriate in a speaking test.\n\n2. **\"Who is your best friend and why?\"**  \n   - *\"I'm confused, my best friend, yes.\"*  \n   - **Evaluation:** This answer is not coherent or logical. The vocabulary is not appropriate (\"I'm confused\"), and the answer is unclear. This shows a lack of lexical competence.\n\n3. **\"Who would you most likely be friends with and why?\"**  \n   - *\"Elon Musk because rich man, okay?\"*  \n   - **Evaluation:** Uses a very simple sentence structure and incorrect grammar (\"because rich man\"). Uses a limited range of vocabulary and shows a lack of fluency and lexical flexibility.\n\n4. **\"What kind of person can you make friends with easily?\"**  \n   - *\"Can I not ask you for a question? I don't ask you question.\"*  \n   - **Evaluation:** This answer is completely off-topic and incoherent. It shows very limited lexical resource and inability to answer the question. The vocabulary used is irrelevant.\n\n5. **\"Which one is more important to you, friends or family?\"**  \n   - *\"I live a life with my family.\"*  \n   - **Evaluation:** This answer is somewhat relevant but not directly answering the question. Uses simple vocabulary (\"live a life,\" \"family\"). Shows very limited lexical resource and difficulty in expressing complex ideas.\n\n#### **Topic: Home**\n\n1. **\"Who do you live with?\"**  \n   - *\"My bad though.\"*  \n   - **Evaluation:** This is completely irrelevant and does not answer the question. Vocabulary is not used appropriately.\n\n2. **\"What is your favorite room in your home?\"**  \n   - *\"This is my bedroom.\"*  \n   - **Evaluation:** Uses only basic vocabulary. The answer is clear, but lacks variety and depth.\n\n3. **\"How is your home decorated?\"**  \n   - *\"Decorated, so so it's decorated.\"*  \n   - **Evaluation:** The candidate repeats the word \"decorated\" and uses a vague and unclear phrase (\"so so\"). This shows minimal vocabulary usage and a lack of descriptive ability.\n\n4. **\"Do you like visitors coming to your home?\"**  \n   - *\"So so, okay, not like, so so, and like, and not like, okay.\"*  \n   - **Evaluation:** This answer is incoherent, unclear, and uses vague phrases (\"so so,\" \"not like\"). There is a complete lack of vocabulary and grammatical structure.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation of Lexical Resource:**\n\nThe **lexical resource** used by the candidate is extremely limited and does not meet even the Band 5 requirements for the IELTS Speaking test. The candidate shows:\n\n- **Very limited vocabulary**\n- **Use of repetitive and incorrect phrases**\n- **Inability to express ideas clearly or coherently**\n- **No range or flexibility in word choice**\n- **Frequent use of irrelevant or non-answers**\n- **Lack of idiomatic expressions or more complex vocabulary**\n\n---\n\n### **Band Estimate for Lexical Resource:**\n\nBased on the answers provided, the **lexical resource** score would be **Band 3 or 4** at most. The candidate\u2019s vocabulary is not sufficient to answer the questions coherently or accurately, and there's no indication of range, flexibility, or appropriate word choice.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Expand vocabulary:** Learn more general and topic-specific vocabulary to express ideas clearly.\n2. **Practice answering questions coherently:** Use linking words and sentence structures to form complete and logical answers.\n3. **Avoid repetition and vague phrases:** Use descriptive language to give more detailed responses.\n4. **Practice speaking fluently:** Avoid hesitation, repetition, and irrelevant answers by practicing with mock interviews or recording yourself.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe candidate\u2019s **Lexical Resource** does not meet the minimum requirements for a Band 5 or higher. The vocabulary used is extremely limited and often irrelevant, and the candidate struggles to express even basic ideas clearly."}

There's a lot of foreigners these days. That's my city's getting popular and popular. So tourists and also a lot of people live there.\"\n\n#### **Lexical Resource Analysis:**\n\n- **Vocabulary Range:** The candidate uses basic vocabulary such as \"small city\", \"mountain\", \"beach\", \"hike\", \"tourists\", etc. There is a **limited range of vocabulary**, which limits the ability to express ideas more precisely.\n- **Repetition:** Words like \"popular\" and \"city\" are repeated unnecessarily. The phrase \"my city's getting popular and popular\" is **repetitive and unidiomatic**.\n- **Word Choice Errors:**\n  - \"not the largest or not the smallest\" is **awkward phrasing** and not idiomatic.\n  - \"I can go like during the summer\" is **colloquial and informal**, which is not suitable for IELTS speaking.\n  - \"That's my city's getting popular and popular\" is **ungrammatical and repetitive**, indicating a **lack of precision and control**.\n- **Synonyms:** There\u2019s little **variation in vocabulary** (e.g., \"small city\" is repeated; there is no alternative term).\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **Verdict:** The vocabulary used is **basic and repetitive**, with **inappropriate phrasing and word choice errors**.

So New Year or like during the summertime, we all got together having a big dinner.\"\n\n#### **Lexical Resource Analysis:**\n\n- **Vocabulary Range:** The candidate uses **basic food-related vocabulary** (\"sushi\", \"ramen\", \"noodle\", \"dinner party\", etc.) but lacks more specific or descriptive language.\n- **Repetition:** \"popular\" is repeated in the sentence \"Probably the popular is two things.\"\n- **Colloquial and Unidiomatic Expressions:**\n  - \"Why? Because I can eat whatever I want. That's the best part.\" \u2013 this is **very informal**, **repetitive**, and lacks sophistication.\n  - \"The sushi is very, some home cooking sushi...\" \u2013 this is **awkward and lacks coherence**.\n  - \"That, you know, that opportunity...\" \u2013 this is **colloquial and lacks fluency**.\n- **Word Choice Errors:**\n  - \"Probably the popular is two things.\" \u2013 incorrect grammar and word choice.\n  - \"We all got together having a big dinner.\" \u2013 **awkward phrasing**, should be \"we all gathered for a big dinner\" or similar.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **Verdict:** The vocabulary is **very basic and informal**, with **repetition and errors in word choice**, which again aligns with a **Band 5.3 Lexical Resource score**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Overall Assessment for Lexical Resource:**\n\n- The candidate uses a **limited range of vocabulary**, **repeats words unnecessarily**, and **uses informal, colloquial, or incorrect expressions**.\n- There is **little evidence of sophisticated or varied vocabulary** to express ideas accurately and clearly.\n- This **limited lexical resource** is consistent with the overall CTTR score of **Band 5.3**, specifically in the **Lexical Resource** criteria.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Summary:**\nThe answers show a **limited vocabulary range**, **repetitive use of words**, and **errors in phrasing or word choice**, all of which support a **Lexical Resource score of Band 5.3**. The candidate would benefit from **practicing more varied and precise vocabulary**, and avoiding **colloquial or informal expressions** in IELTS speaking tests."}

Evaluation for Lexical Resource (Band 6.5 - 7)**\n\n#### **What is Lexical Resource in IELTS Speaking?**\nIt refers to the **range of vocabulary** used and the **accuracy** with which words and phrases are used. It also considers the **appropriacy** of language to the topic and context.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation of Answers: Topic \"Learning a Language\"**\n\n#### **Answer 1:**\n> \"I went to an English language school when I was eight. Most children start learning a foreign language in that age in my country.\"\n\n- **Vocabulary used:**\n  - \"English language school\", \"foreign language\", \"in that age\" (slightly awkward phrasing), \"start learning\", \"in my country\"\n- **Lexical Issues:**\n  - \"in that age\" is not standard phrasing. Use \"at that age\" instead.\n  - \"start learning a foreign language in that age\" \u2013 better phrasing: \"start learning a foreign language at that age\" or \"most children begin learning a foreign language at that age in my country.\"\n- **Score Contribution:** Basic vocabulary is used, but there are **some inaccuracies** or **clunky phrasing**.\n\n#### **Answer 2:**\n> \"There's very much competition for work nowadays, so people need to speak more than one language to find a good job. Also, people can communicate more easier with foreigners.\"\n\n- **Vocabulary used:**\n  - \"competition\", \"speak more than one language\", \"find a good job\", \"communicate more easier\" (incorrect)\n- **Lexical Issues:**\n  - \"more easier\" is **incorrect**; should be **\"more easily\"**.\n  - The sentence structure is clear, but there is **a grammatical error** in the use of an adverb.\n- **Score Contribution:** Vocabulary is appropriate but **some errors** in prepositions and adverbs.\n\n#### **Answer 3:**\n> \"I think all children should learn foreign languages at school because not all families have the money to send their children to a private language school or get a private teacher. This would be fair for all children.\"\n\n- **Vocabulary used:**\n  - \"should learn\", \"not all families have the money\", \"private language school\", \"get a private teacher\", \"fair for all children\"\n- **Lexical Issues:**\n  - Clear, standard vocabulary used.\n  - No significant lexical errors.\n- **Score Contribution:** Strong use of **appropriate and accurate vocabulary**.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation of Answers: Topic \"Media\"**\n\n#### **Answer 1:**\n> \"No, I don't.

I know that advertisements inform you for new products, but I'm not interested and I often find them boring. Some from them are clever and funny, but I'm...\"\n\n- **Vocabulary used:**\n  - \"get angry\", \"stop the program\", \"inform you for new products\" (incorrect), \"find them boring\", \"clever and funny\", \"I'm...\"\n- **Lexical Issues:**\n  - \"inform you for new products\" is **grammatically incorrect** \u2013 should be \"inform you about new products\" or \"advertise new products\".\n  - The last sentence is **incomplete** \u2013 ends with \"I'm...\" which is **ungrammatical** and **unprofessional**.\n- **Score Contribution:** Vocabulary is basic; **significant lexical errors** and **ungrammatical expressions**.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Lexical Resource Evaluation:**\n\n| Aspect | Description | Band Score |\n|------|-------------|------------|\n| **Vocabulary Range** | Limited to moderate; some repetition and lack of variety. | 6 |\n| **Lexical Accuracy** | Several errors in prepositions, adverbs, and phrasing. | 6 |\n| **Appropriacy** | Vocabulary is generally appropriate but with some awkward or incorrect phrasing. | 6.5 |\n| **Use of Collocations & Idiomatic Expressions** | Very limited. | 5.5 |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Score for Lexical Resource: 6.5**\n\nThis is consistent with the **CTTR (Computer-Tested Text Rating) score of 6.275**, which rounds up to **Band 6.5** for Lexical Resource in IELTS Speaking Part 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations to Improve Lexical Resource:**\n1. **Avoid common errors:** Like \"more easier\" or \"inform you for\".\n2. **Use more varied vocabulary:** Avoid repetition of words like \"fashion\" or \"language\".\n3. **Improve collocation use:** For example, \"inform you about\", \"be interested in\", \"find something boring\".\n4. **Expand your range of expression:** Instead of saying \"I like fashion magazines,\" try \"I enjoy reading fashion magazines\" or \"I\u2019m a fan of fashion publications.\"\n5. **Avoid incomplete sentences:** Always complete your thoughts; avoid ending with \"I'm...\" in speech.\n\nBy working on these areas, you can aim for a **Band 7 or higher** in Lexical Resource."}

Key points:\n- **Appropriate vocabulary**: Use of vocabulary that is relevant and appropriate to the topic.\n- **Range of vocabulary**: Use of different vocabulary items, not just repetitive words.\n- **Accurate use of vocabulary**: Minimal errors in grammar and spelling, and correct use of collocations and word forms.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation of Answers**\n\n#### **Topic: Work**\n**Answers:**\n\n1. **\"I am a laboratory assistant in neurological clinic for children.\"**\n   - **Lexical Resource**: \"laboratory assistant\" and \"neurological clinic\" are correct and appropriate. However, the structure \"neurological clinic for children\" could be more natural as \"a neurological clinic for children\" or \"a children's neurological clinic.\"\n   - **Slight issue**: No major lexical issues. Vocabulary is appropriate and shows some specificity.\n\n2. **\"It's very pleasant to see when doctors can help any children to get well and to heal them feel better.\"**\n   - **Lexical Resource**: The use of \"heal them feel better\" is grammatically awkward and semantically unclear.\n   - **Problem**: \"Heal them feel better\" is not a standard collocation. A better phrase could be \"make them feel better\" or \"help them recover.\"\n   - **Suggestion**: Better vocabulary choices and correct collocations.\n\n3. **\"I suppose, yes, because it's very interesting. You meet different cases you've only heard about during your studying, and so I suppose it's a good job.\"**\n   - **Lexical Resource**: \"Cases you've only heard about during your studying\" \u2013 \"studying\" is less formal. \"During your studies\" is more appropriate.\n   - **Vocabulary**: The vocabulary is clear and appropriate. However, the language is somewhat basic and lacks richness.\n\n#### **Lexical Resource Banding for Work Topic:**\n- **Band 6.0\u20136.5**: Vocabulary is generally clear and appropriate, but limited in range and sometimes imprecise or awkwardly phrased.\n\n---\n\n#### **Topic: Advertising**\n**Answers:**\n\n1. **\"Okay, oh of course yes, if they are interesting. I watch them if they are interesting.\"**\n   - **Lexical Resource**: Repetition of \"interesting\" and the use of \"okay, oh\" suggests hesitation and limited vocabulary.\n   - **Issue**: Vocabulary is very limited and repetitive.\n\n2. **\"Maybe unconsciously, I don't know, with the advertisement is very good, maybe I translated it into me, to me, and maybe I, I don't know, unconsciously I want to buy the product they advertise.\"**\n   - **Lexical Resource**: There's a lot of hesitation, repeated phrases, and awkward phrasing (e.g., \"translated it into me\").\n   - **Issue**: The vocabulary is not fluent and the message is unclear due to poor phrasing and word choice.\n\n3. **\"If they have a special style that fits the city maybe it looks good, but if it don't fit, if it doesn't fit, it's not very pleasant to see.\"**\n   - **Lexical Resource**: \"If it don't fit\" is grammatically incorrect.

There are many filler words and unclear phrasing.\n   - **Issue**: The vocabulary is unclear and lacks precision and fluency.\n\n#### **Lexical Resource Banding for Advertising Topic:**\n- **Band 5.0\u20135.5**: Vocabulary is very basic and repetitive. There is a lack of appropriate collocations and fluency.\n\n---\n\n#### **Topic: Shops**\n**Answers:**\n\n1. **\"Um, City Mall, it is called just like that. Um, it's big shopping center with different, uh, stores of different, uh, brands.\"**\n   - **Lexical Resource**: \"It\u2019s big shopping center\" \u2013 missing article (\"a\").\n   - **Vocabulary**: The vocabulary is appropriate but limited. The hesitation and filler words (\"um\", \"uh\") reduce the fluency and clarity.\n\n2. **\"Bookstores and disc and video store, I like, I don't know, it's a very good atmosphere in there and I like to visit them to just, just watch, not maybe buy any anything because it's cheaper to buy the items in the, on the internet.\"**\n   - **Lexical Resource**: The sentence structure is somewhat unclear (\"not maybe buy any anything\").\n   - **Vocabulary**: The vocabulary is appropriate but the phrasing is awkward and repetitive.\n\n3. **\"I suppose yes, because there is a clear example, for example, the Pionerskaya metro station. The city mall, which is close to the station, is much more popular than the other center, Capitolium, which is farther, and it's now going to become the discount center because no one goes there for shopping.\"**\n   - **Lexical Resource**: This is the best response in terms of vocabulary.

For instance:\n- \"we're also missing something with using our memory less\" \u2192 unclear and non-idiomatic.\n- \"pop up at a certain time\" is fine, but not the most advanced expression.\n\n#### 4. **Colloquial and Hesitation Markers**\nThe answer includes **many hesitation markers** such as:\n- \"um\"\n- \"uh\"\n- \"like\"\n- \"you know\"\n- \"I mean\"\n- \"just again\"\n\nThese **do not contribute to lexical range** and **can detract from the fluency and clarity** of the response, which is a concern for a **Band 7+ score**.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Lexical Resource Evaluation (Band Score)**\n\nBased on the content, range, and accuracy of vocabulary:\n\n- **Vocabulary Range:** **Moderate** \u2013 the candidate uses a reasonable range of words related to the topic, but **could have used more varied and precise synonyms**.\n- **Accuracy:** **Moderate to Low** \u2013 some vocabulary is used **inaccurately or inappropriately**, and the candidate relies on **colloquial speech** and **repetitive phrasing**.\n- **Hesitations:** **High** \u2013 the answer is **full of hesitation markers**, which reduce the impression of fluency and control over vocabulary.\n- **Formality:** **Low to Moderate** \u2013 the language is **not consistently formal**, which may be appropriate for speaking, but not ideal for a higher band score.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Lexical Resource Band Score: 6.0**\n\nThe CTTR score of **6.462** aligns with a **Band 6.0** in **Lexical Resource**, as it suggests a **moderate level of vocabulary range and accuracy**, with some **repetition and hesitation**, but still sufficient to cover the topic.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement**\n\nTo improve Lexical Resource:\n- **Use synonyms and paraphrase** (e.g., instead of repeating \"forgetful,\" use \u201cprone to memory lapses\u201d or \u201ceasily forgetful\u201d).\n- **Avoid colloquial expressions and hesitation markers**.\n- **Practice using more formal, precise, and varied vocabulary** in speaking practice.\n- **Use idiomatic expressions** when appropriate (e.g., \u201crelying too much on technology\u201d or \u201cmemory is atrophy\u201d).\n- **Avoid repetition of phrases** and focus on **sentence variation** and **complex vocabulary**.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you rewrite parts of the answers with more advanced vocabulary and clearer expression."}

They are quite popular. It depends on like, the person actually. Like, people, designer clothes are usually very expensive, so only people of certain social, I mean, socioeconomic class can buy those clothes. So they are popular in certain segments of the society, yes.  \n> I think because it has a social status attached to it, so when you're buying, like when you're wearing a specific label, people recognize it, and then it shows, like, what kind of class you belong to, and it is a huge thing in India, I think. So, I think it's because of that. It shows, like, you are from a different class of society, and it shows your affluence, I think. You can flaunt your affluence that way. Maybe that.\n\n#### **Lexical Resource Evaluation:**\n- **Vocabulary Range**: The speaker uses basic vocabulary related to clothing, social class, and social status (e.g., *designer clothes, socioeconomic class, social status, affluence, flaunt*). There is a **limited range** of vocabulary, with some repetition of ideas (e.g., *social class* is used multiple times).\n- **Accuracy**: The vocabulary is mostly accurate, but there is some **colloquial and informal language** (e.g., *Oh yes, I think so, yeah, like, I mean, maybe that*). There are also **minor grammatical errors** in sentence structure, but not all of them are vocabulary errors.\n- **Use of Function Words**: The speaker uses a **limited range of function words** (e.g., *because, so, like, that*), which can sometimes hinder fluency and clarity.\n- **Lexical Diversity**: The vocabulary is **not very diverse**. There is a lack of more sophisticated or nuanced expressions (e.g., *socioeconomic class* is used, but not elaborated on).\n- **Lexical Appropriateness**: The vocabulary is **appropriate** for the topic, but it lacks sophistication and depth.\n\n**Score: 6.0 \u2013 6.5**  \nThe speaker uses **basic and appropriate vocabulary** with **some repetition and a limited range**, but **no serious errors in word choice**. The vocabulary is clear enough to convey the message, but it lacks sophistication.\n\n---\n\n### **Answer 2: Working clothes \u2013 Part 3**\n\n#### **Original Answers:**\n\n> I personally don't [think you can judge someone based on clothes], but I think there is a certain image attached to what you're wearing and people build up perspectives about how someone is based on what they're wearing, I think. But personally, I don't.\n\n> Well, they shouldn't be forced, but I think ever since like we were young, we are told to wear certain clothes in certain settings because it's appropriate. So in schools we wear uniforms and we are trained that way. When we go to a temple, we have a certain set of clothes, when we have festivals, we have a certain set of clothes. So I think when we are trained to dress in a certain way in a certain setting, you get used to it. So I don't think it's a, it's a, like people are forcing you to wear formal clothes in an office setting, but, uh, it's a tricky one. Um, well, I don't think someone should be forced, but as individuals, we should be aware enough of what not to wear in an official setting. So we should make that decision by ourselves. You don't feel like you're forced to do it.\n\n> I think it has become less formal now in in a lot of setting like I think companies like Google have made it really popular to where like engineers that are like smartest of people they just go to office wearing casual clothes just in a t-shirt and jeans which is very casual and they they lay more importance on on your work ethic like how how you work and how you how much you contribute rather than what you wear so that is really a refreshing change I think so it doesn't it shouldn't matter what you wear but like how you work and how much you contribute so I think times are changing and people are really getting more relaxed about what you wear\n\n#### **Lexical Resource Evaluation:**\n- **Vocabulary Range**: The speaker uses **a wide range of vocabulary**, including terms related to work ethics, casual clothing, social norms, and modern workplace culture (e.g., *casual clothes, work ethic, relaxed about what you wear, formal clothes*).\n- **Accuracy**: There are **some errors in word choice and phrasing**, especially in the third answer (e.g., *in in a lot of setting, to where like engineers that are like smartest of people*). These are more **stylistic errors** than lexical errors, but they do impact clarity.\n- **Lexical Diversity**: The speaker demonstrates **good lexical diversity**, using terms like *perspectives, appropriate, formal, relaxed, refreshing change*, and more.\n- **Lexical Appropriateness**: The vocabulary used is **appropriate to the topic** and the level of the speaking test. There are no serious issues with word choice.\n- **Use of Colloquial Language**: There is **some use of filler words** (e.g., *uh, um, like, I think, so*), which may indicate **less lexical precision**, but this is common in informal speech.\n\n**Score: 6.5 \u2013 7.0**  \nThe speaker uses **adequate vocabulary** with **some repetition and filler words**, but shows **good lexical diversity and appropriateness**. The vocabulary is **clear and accurate** in conveying ideas, though not highly sophisticated.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Lexical Resource Evaluation:**\n\n| Part     | Score Range | Reason |\n|----------|-------------|--------|\n| Part 3 (Designer clothes) | 6.0 \u2013 6.5 | Limited vocabulary range with some repetition and informal expressions. Appropriate for the topic, but lacks sophistication. |\n| Part 3 (Working clothes)  | 6.5 \u2013 7.0 | More sophisticated vocabulary with good lexical diversity and accuracy. Some filler words but appropriate for the topic. |\n\n### **Final Lexical Resource Band Score:**\n- **Overall Band Score: 6.2 \u2013 6.5**  \nThis is consistent with the **CTTR score of 6.214**, which falls within the **Band 6** range, with some **potential for Band 6.5** if the lexical complexity and sophistication were slightly higher.\n\n---\n\n### **Suggestions for Improvement:**\n- **Expand vocabulary range**: Use more precise and varied synonyms (e.g., *socioeconomic class* could be replaced with *high-income group* or *upper-class individuals*).\n- **Avoid filler words**: Reduce the use of *uh, um, like* to increase fluency and lexical precision.\n- **Use more formal academic vocabulary**: In Part 3, it's appropriate to use more academic terms to demonstrate a higher level of lexical resource (e.g., *prestige, status symbol, professional demeanor*).\n- **Avoid repetition**: Use paraphrasing to avoid repeating the same words or phrases (e.g., instead of saying *social class* three times, use *social strata, socioeconomic group, etc.*).\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a **band score explanation** or **model answers** to improve lexical resource!"}

For example, *\"history keeps repeating itself\"* is correct, but there are no more advanced or natural expressions used in the answers.\n\n- **Lexical Flexibility:**  \n  There is limited flexibility in vocabulary, and the speaker often uses similar expressions in different parts of the answer (e.g., repeated use of the word *\"remember\"* and *\"memory\"*).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Lexical Resource Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n\n| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |\n|---------------|----------------|\n| Basic vocabulary related to the topic is used appropriately. | Frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing impact clarity. |\n| Some collocations (e.g., *\"history keeps repeating itself\"*) are used correctly. | Limited use of more advanced or idiomatic vocabulary. |\n| The speaker attempts to vary vocabulary, though not successfully. | Overuse of repetition and filler words (e.g., \"basically,\" \"you know,\" \"I think\"). |\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Expand Vocabulary Range:**  \n   Practice using more advanced and varied vocabulary related to memory, history, and social media (e.g., *retrospective, nostalgia, archival, cultural legacy, historical significance*).\n\n2. **Improve Grammatical Accuracy and Sentence Structure:**  \n   Focus on constructing more complex and grammatically correct sentences to express ideas clearly and accurately.\n\n3. **Use Appropriate Collocations and Idioms:**  \n   Practice using idiomatic expressions related to memory and history (e.g., *\"cherish memories,\" \"keep in mind,\" \"preserve history\"*, etc.).\n\n4. **Reduce the Use of Filler Words and Repetition:**  \n   Aim for more fluent delivery by reducing the use of fillers like *\"basically,\" \"you know,\" \"I think\"* and avoid repeating words unnecessarily.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Score for Lexical Resource: Band 6.0 (with room for improvement)**\n\nIf the candidate improves on vocabulary range, accuracy, and fluency in the use of language, they could expect a higher score (6.5 or above) in the Lexical Resource criterion."}

{"label": "Band score Lexical Resource: 5", "pred": "Your provided answers for the IELTS Speaking Part 3 are being evaluated for the **\"Lexical Resource\"** rubric. Here's an analysis of the lexical (vocabulary) performance based on the IELTS Speaking band descriptors:\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Lexical Resource Evaluation: Band 6.0**\n(Note: The CTTR score of **6.102** is likely a computational score, which may not be directly equivalent to the official IELTS band score, but we will evaluate the answers based on IELTS standards.)\n\n---\n\n### **Strengths in Lexical Resource:**\n\n1. **Use of Appropriate Vocabulary for the Topic:**\n   - The speaker attempts to use vocabulary related to **cultural identity** and **citizenship**, such as *culture, language, traditions, assimilate, globalisation, rules, respect, behave, harm, conditions, laws, etc.*\n   - These are relevant to the topic and generally appropriate.\n\n2. **Use of Some Complex Words:**\n   - Words like *assimilate, traditions, languages, globalisation* are used appropriately, showing some knowledge of academic vocabulary.\n\n3. **Use of Collocations and Phrases:**\n   - The speaker makes use of expressions like *\u201cborn and raised in different conditions,\u201d* *\u201cdifferent point of views at different problems,\u201d* *\u201cmake any harm,\u201d* and *\u201cbehave yourself like you want other people behave with you.\u201d* These are natural and reasonably accurate, though not always precise.\n\n---\n\n### **Weaknesses in Lexical Resource:**\n\n1. **Frequent Repetition of Words:**\n   - The speaker repeatedly uses the word **\u201ctraditions\u201d** (four times in the first part of the answer), which shows a lack of lexical variety.\n   - The word **\u201cum,\u201d** **\u201cuh,\u201d** and **\u201cI don't know\u201d** appears frequently, indicating hesitation and lack of confidence in vocabulary.\n\n2. **Limited Range of Vocabulary:**\n   - The vocabulary used is mostly basic and repetitive. There is little use of more sophisticated or precise terms that would be expected at a higher band (e.g., *cultural norms, societal values, multiculturalism, diaspora, assimilation vs. integration*).\n   - Words like *\u201cbehave yourself like you want others behave with you\u201d* are not grammatically correct or coherent, and suggest confusion or lack of vocabulary.\n\n3. **Lack of Cohesive Linking Words and Phrases:**\n   - While the speaker attempts to make connections between ideas (e.g., \u201cBecause they weren\u2019t adapted to the conditions which were changed\u201d), the sentence structure and vocabulary are often unclear or incoherent.\n\n4. **Misuse or Inaccuracy of Some Words:**\n   - Phrases like *\u201cnot to bother other people\u201d* are vague and could be expressed more clearly with more precise vocabulary.\n   - The speaker struggles to recall words and often says *\u201cI don't know,\u201d* *\u201cI can't remember,\u201d* or *\u201cI forgot the word.\u201d* This shows a lack of confidence and fluency in vocabulary retrieval.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Expand Vocabulary Range:**\n   - Learn and practice more advanced vocabulary related to the topic, such as:\n     - *cultural preservation, heritage, social cohesion, national identity, assimilation, integration, multiculturalism, diaspora.*\n     - *citizenship, civic responsibility, political rights, civil society, social contract, legal obligations.*\n\n2. **Improve Lexical Accuracy:**\n   - Avoid overusing the same words.\n   - Practice paraphrasing common ideas to avoid repetition.\n\n3. **Build Confidence in Vocabulary Retrieval:**\n   - Practice speaking with more fluency, using vocabulary in context rather than memorizing isolated words.\n\n4. **Use Appropriate Collocations:**\n   - Learn how to pair words correctly (e.g., *\u201crespect laws and traditions,\u201d* *\u201cpreserve cultural identity,\u201d* *\u201cadapt to changing conditions,\u201d* *\u201cglobalization and cultural erosion\u201d*).\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the evaluation, the **lexical resource** of the answers would likely score **Band 6.0** in the IELTS Speaking test. The speaker has a basic understanding of the vocabulary required for the topics but shows limited range, precision, and fluency. With targeted vocabulary practice and more confidence in retrieving and using words, the score can be improved to **Band 6.5 or higher.**"}

Repetition and Limited Range**\n- The answers are **full of repetition** \u2013 e.g., **\"lie\"**, **\"truth\"**, **\"tell the truth\"**, **\"lie to others\"**.\n- The candidate uses **simple and repetitive sentence structures**, with many **grammatical errors** and **hesitations** that suggest limited lexical flexibility.\n- There is **very little variation in vocabulary**, even in expressing the same idea multiple times (e.g., \u201cI don\u2019t like lying,\u201d \u201cI want to be a person who always tells the truth,\u201d \u201ctruth person\u201d).\n\n#### **2. Use of Simple and Basic Vocabulary**\n- The vocabulary used is **basic**, with **no complex or sophisticated words**.\n- The candidate doesn\u2019t demonstrate **ability to use phrasal verbs**, **idiomatic expressions**, or **nuanced terms** related to the topic of lying (e.g., \"white lie,\" \"social lie,\" \"deception,\" etc.).\n\n#### **3. Spoken Language Features**\n- The responses are **not fluent** or **natural-sounding**. The speaking patterns suggest **low proficiency** in using language appropriately in a conversational setting.\n- There are many **repetitions** (e.g., \"tell the truth\" is repeated multiple times), **self-corrections**, and **pauses**.\n\n#### **4. Contextual Vocabulary**\n- The answers do not use vocabulary that reflects a **nuanced understanding** of the topic. For instance, when discussing lying to protect someone's feelings, the candidate uses **very simplistic expressions** without any **idiomatic or sophisticated language**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion on Lexical Resource Score**\n\nThe **CTTR score of 5.235** aligns closely with a **Band 5.5** on the **Lexical Resource** rubric. Here's why:\n\n- **Band 5.5:** Uses a **limited range of vocabulary**, with **some basic expressions**, but with **noticeable repetition** and **little flexibility**.\n- The answers lack **variety in vocabulary**, **complex phrasing**, and **appropriate register** for a speaking test at B2+ level.\n- The candidate shows **some attempts** to use new vocabulary but with **frequent errors** and **limited range**, which prevents a higher score.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation for Improvement**\nTo improve Lexical Resource score:\n- Expand vocabulary by learning more specific and formal expressions.\n- Practice using **synonyms** for repeated words (e.g., instead of just \u201clie,\u201d try \u201cdeception,\u201d \u201cmisrepresentation,\u201d \u201csocial lie\u201d).\n- Avoid overusing basic phrases and try to use **idiomatic expressions** and **complex sentence structures**.\n- Listen to native speakers or IELTS model answers to learn how to express similar ideas with more nuance and flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Lexical Resource Score: **5.5** (based on the CTTR and the lexical features in the answers)."}

Accuracy of Lexical Choice:**\n\n- **Strengths:**\n  - The speaker uses **appropriate and accurate vocabulary** for the context, especially when discussing the craft and the emotional significance (e.g., *\"spending time with my mum\"*, *\"family tradition\"*).\n  - The use of **phrasal verbs** and **colloquial expressions** adds naturalness (e.g., \"didn't send us a card back,\" \"got better as I got older\").\n\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - There are a few **minor errors** in lexical usage:\n    - **\"we started when I was around seven years old\"** \u2013 while grammatically correct, the phrasing is a bit informal and could be more precise.\n    - **\"the year before\"** \u2013 should be *\"the previous year\"* or *\"the year before that\"*, depending on context.\n    - **\"I do enjoy making things, but more in a, uh, in a digital way\"** \u2013 the hesitation shows that the speaker may not have a fully formed concept to express, but this is more about fluency than lexical resource.\n  - Some words are **used incorrectly or in a vague way** (e.g., *\"nitty-gritty\"*, which is a bit of a clich\u00e9, and could be replaced with more concrete language).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Overall Lexical Resource Assessment (Band 6.5 \u2013 7.0):**\n\n- The speaker demonstrates **a sufficient range of vocabulary** for the task.\n- The **vocabulary is mostly accurate** and appropriate for the topic.\n- The speaker could **benefit from more varied and precise vocabulary**, especially in describing the craft itself (e.g., using specific terms like *\"cutting out shapes,\" \"folding,\" \"pasting,\"* etc.).\n- The speaker\u2019s **personal and emotional vocabulary** is strong, which enhances the narrative.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion for Lexical Resource Band:**\n\n- **Band 6.5** would be appropriate if the assessor is strict and values precision and variation in vocabulary highly.\n- **Band 7.0** is more likely if the assessor considers the **emotional and narrative quality** of the response, **colloquial expressions**, and the **overall fluency** of the language.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n- **Expand your vocabulary** by learning more specific terms related to crafts (e.g., *\"collage,\" \"decoration,\" \"layering,\" \"pasting,\" \"embellishing\"*).\n- Avoid **overuse of phrases** like \u201cwith my mum\u201d \u2013 consider rephrasing to add variation.\n- **Practice describing crafts and activities** in more detail, using varied vocabulary.\n- **Use more precise language** to explain your feelings and experiences (e.g., instead of \u201cit was a lot of fun,\u201d say \u201cit was a rewarding and joyful experience\u201d).\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a revised version of the answer with improved vocabulary!"}

To evaluate the answer under the **\"Lexical Resource\"** criterion, we need to examine the **range of vocabulary used**, the **accuracy of word choice**, and the **appropriateness** of the language in relation to the topic.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation of \"Lexical Resource\" (Band 6.5)**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The candidate uses a **reasonable range of vocabulary** related to food and eating experiences. For example: \"Greek salad,\" \"lettuce,\" \"cucumber,\" \"tomatoes,\" \"olives,\" \"cheese,\" \"olive oil,\" \"lemon juice,\" \"courtyard,\" \"plants and flowers,\" \"cool breeze,\" \"fresh,\" \"juicy,\" \"crisp,\" \"creamy,\" \"secret,\" \"family's garden.\"\n- There is some **descriptive language** used to convey the sensory experience of the meal, such as \"everything just tasted so fresh and full of flavor.\"\n- The vocabulary is **mostly appropriate** and **accurate** for the topic.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- There are **some limited collocations** or **uncommon phrases** that are either incorrect or not fully idiomatic. For example:\n  - \"It was a Greek salad made of lettuces\" \u2013 \"lettuce\" is not commonly used in plural as \"lettuces\" (usually \"lettuce\" is used as a mass noun).\n  - \"I mean dressing\" \u2013 this shows hesitation and uncertainty in vocabulary.\n  - \"I wasn't really expecting very much, but when I took my first mouthful, I was in heaven\" \u2013 while this is understandable, it's somewhat clich\u00e9 and lacks originality.\n  - The phrase \"the secret was in the ingredients\" is acceptable, but the vocabulary doesn't show much variety.\n- There is a **lack of sophisticated or academic vocabulary**, which could be used to enhance the description (e.g., \"authentic,\" \"locally sourced,\" \"sustainably grown\").\n- Some **repetition** in vocabulary, such as the repeated use of adjectives like \"fresh,\" \"juicy,\" \"crisp,\" etc., without enough variation.\n- Limited use of **phrasal verbs** or **complex sentence structures** to show a broader range of lexical resource.\n\n---\n\n### **Band Score Explanation for Lexical Resource:**\n\nBased on the criteria for the **Lexical Resource** rubric in IELTS Speaking:\n\n| Band Score | Lexical Resource Description |\n|-----------|------------------------------|\n| **7.0**   | A wide range of vocabulary is used with only occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation. The language is appropriate to the task. |\n| **6.5**   | A limited range of vocabulary is used with some repetition. There is some flexibility in word choice, but it is limited, and the vocabulary is sometimes not accurate or appropriate. |\n| **6.0**   | Attempts to use a range of vocabulary are limited and there is some repetition. The vocabulary used is often inappropriate or inaccurate. |\n| **5.5**   | There is a limited range of vocabulary and limited use of appropriate language. |\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment for Lexical Resource: Band 6.5**\n\nYour answer shows **some appropriate vocabulary** related to food and eating experiences, but it lacks the **variety, sophistication, and accuracy** that would place it in the higher band categories. The candidate uses **basic and somewhat repetitive language** and has **some inaccuracies** in word choice (e.g., \"lettuces,\" \"I mean dressing\"). However, the candidate **does demonstrate some ability to express the experience** and uses descriptive language effectively.\n\nTherefore, a **band score of 6.5** is **reasonable** and **justified** for \"Lexical Resource.\" The **CTTR of 6.403** aligns well with this assessment."}
{"label": "Band score Lexical Resource: 9", "pred": "The answer provided for the **IELTS Speaking Part 2** topic \"Describe a gift or a present that someone gave you recently\" can be evaluated under the **Lexical Resource** rubric as follows:\n\n---\n\n### **Lexical Resource Rubric Overview (Band Score 6.935):**\n\nThe **Lexical Resource** criterion assesses the **range of vocabulary** used and the **accuracy** of that vocabulary in the context of the task. It also considers whether appropriate vocabulary is used to **describe, explain, and discuss** the topic clearly and coherently.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluation of Lexical Resource (Band 6.935):**\n\n#### \u2705 **Strengths:**\n\n1. **Appropriate and Varied Vocabulary:**\n   - The candidate uses a **wide range of vocabulary** related to **art, travel, and emotions**. Words like *\"captivated,\" \"breathtaking,\" \"exquisite,\" \"startling,\" \"tile shops,\" \"negotiate,\" \"wrapped gift,\" \"heavily wrapped\"* show an ability to use **descriptive and precise vocabulary.**\n   - Phrases such *\"it sang to me\"* and *\"I was totally captivated\"* demonstrate **creative and idiomatic expression**, which reflects good lexical range.\n\n2. **Descriptive Language:**\n   - The candidate uses **rich descriptive language** to describe the gift and the occasion (e.g., *\"the large windows with the light reflecting on the exquisite blue tiles,\" \"different shades of green,\" \"most beautifully wrapped gift\"*), which contributes to a **high level of lexical resource**.\n\n3. **Use of Specific Nouns and Adjectives:**\n   - The candidate uses **specific nouns** such as *Iznik tiles, Blue Mosque, Ottoman mosque, tile shops,* and **descriptive adjectives** such as *exquisite, breathtaking, startling, heavy, beautifully wrapped* \u2013 all indicating **strong lexical control.**\n\n---\n\n#### \u26a0\ufe0f **Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Occasional Lexical Repetition:**\n   - The candidate uses phrases like *\"I really, really wanted it\"* and *\"I was totally captivated\"*. While this adds emphasis, it could be replaced with more varied expressions (e.g., *\"I was absolutely enamored with it\"* or *\"it was truly mesmerizing\"*).\n\n2. **Slight Awkwardness in Expression:**\n   - The phrase *\"It sang to me\"* is **creative but somewhat informal**, which is acceptable in the IELTS Speaking test, but **could be more standard in formal speaking** (e.g., *\"It caught my attention immediately\"* or *\"It really appealed to me\"*).\n\n3. **Some Lexical Overlap:**\n   - The answer uses the word *\"tile\"* multiple times (e.g., *\"tiles,\" \"tile shops,\" \"fish tile\"*). While it\u2019s clear, a more varied vocabulary (e.g., *\"ceramic tile,\" \"mosaic,\" \"Iznik tile\"*) could enhance the lexical range further.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The candidate displays **good to very good lexical resource** with **appropriate, varied, and accurate vocabulary**, and **effective use of descriptive and idiomatic language** to convey meaning.\n- **Slight repetition and occasional informal phrasing** could be refined.\n- **Band Score: 6.935** reflects **strong lexical resource**, with only minor flaws that do not significantly impact understanding or coherence.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n- Use **more sophisticated and varied synonyms** to avoid repetition (e.g., *captivated*, *mesmerized*, *fascinated*).\n- Expand **formal expressions** for more academic or standard IELTS-style speaking.\n- Replace **overused or informal phrasing** with more conventional language (e.g., *\"It sang to me\" \u2192 \"It truly captured my attention\"*).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Verdict:**\n\n- **Lexical Resource Band: 6.5-7.0**\n- **Overall Band: 6.935**, which is consistent with the lexical resource component of that score.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a revised version of the answer to improve lexical resource!"}

These words are generally appropriate for the task and convey meaning.\n- The speaker attempts to **use a variety of vocabulary** related to books, learning, and personal experiences.\n- There is **some use of academic and descriptive vocabulary**, such as *\"vast of items\"*, *\"eye-catchy\"*, and *\"super shop\"*, which suggests the speaker can use more formal and varied expressions.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n- There are **several grammatical and lexical errors** that affect clarity and precision. For example:\n  - *\"we've got vasts of items\"* (should be *\"vast number of items\"* or *\"vast amount of information\"*).\n  - *\"the middle of the year, so one of my friends from my university who suggested that if you really want to improve your English, you should start from learning the grammars because it not just help you to feel confident but also it really help you to improve your accuracy level.\"* \u2014 This sentence is very long and convoluted, making it harder to follow.

However, there are **several issues** affecting the **lexical resource score**:\n\n#### \u2705 **Strengths:**\n- The candidate uses **some specific vocabulary** related to the topic (e.g., football, club, Barcelona, computer games).\n- **Topic coherence is maintained** \u2013 the answer stays on-topic throughout.\n- There is **some attempt to elaborate** on the hobby (e.g., the benefits of playing football, the clubs they like, the types of games they play).\n\n#### \u274c **Weaknesses:**\n- **Repetition of vocabulary**: Words like \"like\" and \"too much\" are used **repeatedly**, indicating a **limited range of vocabulary**.\n- **Grammatical errors** (e.g., \"Play football is good hobby\", \"I also like watch football\") limit the clarity of the message, though this is also assessed under grammar, not lexical resource.\n- **Collocations are not always accurate** (e.g., \"you must to run\" instead of \"you have to run\").\n- **Vocabulary is simplistic** with little **variety or sophistication** (e.g., \"happy and hungry\", \"I like too much computer games\").\n- **Some expressions are unclear** (e.g., \"we win lots\", \"we play car and war games\").\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Lexical Resource Assessment: Band 5.0**\n- The candidate uses **basic vocabulary** to describe the topic, but with **limited range, repetition, and errors that reduce clarity**.\n- The answer does not demonstrate the **flexibility and accuracy** expected for a **Band 6.0+** score in **lexical resource**.\n- The **word choice is simple and limited**, and there is **little attempt to use more sophisticated or varied vocabulary**.\n\n---\n\n### **Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\nTo improve **lexical resource** in IELTS Speaking, the candidate should:\n\n- Use **more varied vocabulary** (e.g., instead of just \"like,\" use \"enjoy,\" \"fond of,\" \"am passionate about\").\n- Use **more precise expressions** (e.g., \"play football\" \u2192 \"kick a football,\" \"participate in football matches\").\n- Use **collocations** (e.g., \"watch football matches on TV,\" \"play computer games\").\n- Expand **topic vocabulary** with **related words and phrases** (e.g., physical exercise, team sports, leisure activities, hobbies, recreation).\n- Avoid **repeating the same words and phrases** throughout the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Rating: Band 5.0 for Lexical Resource** \u2705\n\nIf you'd like, I can also evaluate the other criteria (Grammatical Range and Accuracy, Coherence and Cohesion, Pronunciation) for a full Band Score assessment."}
{"label": "Band score Lexical Resource: 5", "pred": "To evaluate the **\"Lexical Resource\"** band score for the **IELTS Speaking Part 2** answer provided, let's analyze it based on the official **IELTS Speaking Band Descriptors** for Lexical Resource (from the IELTS Speaking test rubric). This criterion assesses the **range of vocabulary** used and the **accuracy and appropriateness** of that vocabulary in the context of the answer.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Range of Vocabulary (Lexical Resource)**\n\n**Assessment:**\n\nThe answer exhibits **very limited vocabulary** and **repetition** of key terms. The speaker uses **basic, simple language** with **significant grammatical and lexical errors**, which makes the meaning unclear at times. Examples include:\n\n- **\"I think is environment problem is air pollution is seriously problem.\"** \u2013 multiple errors in sentence structure and word choice (e.g., \"is environment problem\", \"seriously problem\").\n- **\"Usually the happening beginning is China factory.\"** \u2013 unclear phrasing.\n- **\"They too much making lot of things.\"** \u2013 incorrect grammar and word choice (\"too much making\").\n- **\"Reduce the time, making time or the time have to 10 or 12 in the days.\"** \u2013 incoherent phrasing.\n- **\"People have to think the air pollution is really serious.\"** \u2013 grammatically incorrect but somewhat clear in meaning.\n\nThe vocabulary is mostly limited to **basic, everyday words**, and **very few specialized environmental terms** are used. There is **little attempt at varied expression or precise vocabulary** appropriate to the topic of environmental problems.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Accuracy and Appropriate Use of Lexical Items**\n\n**Assessment:**\n\nThere is a **high number of lexical errors** that hinder understanding. Examples include:\n\n- **Incorrect prepositions**: \"is happening beginning\", \"in the days\", \"has to be good to our in futures\".\n- **Word choice errors**: \"problem solve to government\", \"international government's policy have to make them\", \"the making the advertise to people\".\n- **Misuse of articles**: \"the happening beginning\", \"the making time\".\n\nThe speaker is **not using appropriate collocations or phrasal verbs**, which reduces the clarity of the message. Additionally, some sentences are **incomplete or non-sensical**, suggesting a **lack of command over vocabulary and grammar**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Conclusion on Lexical Resource Band Score**\n\nGiven the **very limited range of vocabulary**, **high frequency of lexical errors**, and **repetition of basic language**, the Lexical Resource score would be in the **Band 4.0\u20135.0 range**, depending on the overall coherence and fluency of the answer.\n\nHowever, based on the **CTTR (Coherence, Task Response, and Lexical Resource)** score provided (CTTR: 4.047), and the **analysis of vocabulary**, the **Lexical Resource band score** would likely be **Band 4.0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Lexical Range**: Very limited.\n- **Lexical Accuracy**: Many errors that affect understanding.\n- **Appropriacy of Vocabulary**: Basic, with very few environmental terms.\n- **Estimated Lexical Resource Band Score**: **Band 4.0**\n\n---\n\nWould you like suggestions on how to **improve lexical resource** for IELTS Speaking?"}

Let's break it down:\n\n---\n\n### **Strengths:**\n\n1. **Basic vocabulary** is used appropriately for the task (e.g., \"farm,\" \"farmland,\" \"farmer,\" \"trees,\" \"animals\").\n2. The speaker is able to **communicate the core information** required for the task: the place (parents\u2019 land), time (rarely go there), what was there (trees, animals), and feelings (free, happy).\n3. Some **personal reflection** is present, e.g., \"I think the feel of being a farmer is to be a free man.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Repetition and basic language** is overused:\n   - Words like \"be\" are used in incorrect or repetitive ways (e.g., \"to be free,\" \"to be a farmer,\" \"to be a free man\").\n   - \"I think\" is overused multiple times.\n   - Repetition of phrases such as \"makes me so be happy\" (ungrammatical), \"I should better go this to be a farmer\" (ungrammatical).\n\n2. **Lexical inaccuracies**:\n   - \"I think I should better start with my parents\u2019 land...\" \u2192 unclear and incorrect structure.\n   - \"I never tried to be a farmer for now\" \u2192 grammatically incorrect.\n   - \"It makes so happy\" \u2192 incorrect structure (should be \"It makes me so happy\").\n   - \"I should better go this to be a farmer\" \u2192 incorrect phrase.\n\n3. **Limited lexical variety**:\n   - There is little use of **descriptive language** or **complex vocabulary** that might be expected in a higher-band answer.\n   - Little use of **phrasal verbs**, **idiomatic expressions**, or **specific vocabulary** related to farming or rural life.\n\n4. **Grammatical errors** interfere with clarity and coherence:\n   - While grammatical accuracy is evaluated separately, the **choice and use of vocabulary** is **limited and repetitive**, reducing clarity and impact.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe answer shows a **basic understanding of the vocabulary** required to talk about a visit to a farm. However, the **lexical resource is limited** due to:\n\n- Repetition and overuse of simple language\n- Grammatical errors that affect vocabulary use\n- Lack of specific or descriptive vocabulary\n\nThis aligns with the **band score of 4.763**, which is **close to a 5 band** in **Lexical Resource**, but the answer falls just short of 5 due to the **limited range and accuracy of vocabulary**.\n\n---\n\n### **Suggested improvements for higher band scores (e.g., Band 6.0 or above):**\n\n- Use a **wider range of vocabulary** (e.g., \"agricultural land,\" \"rural area,\" \"livestock,\" \"harvesting\").\n- Improve **sentence structure** and **grammatical accuracy** to support more **varied vocabulary**.\n- Use **more descriptive adjectives** to enhance the imagery (e.g., \"bustling farm,\" \"lush green fields,\" \"tranquil atmosphere\").\n- Avoid repeating the same verbs and nouns (e.g., \"be\" instead of \"was\" or \"am\").\n\nLet me know if you'd like a revised version of the answer with higher lexical resource!"}

Range of Vocabulary (Lexical Resource)**\n\nThe answer uses **basic vocabulary** to talk about a personal experience (e.g., \"moved\", \"relatives\", \"origin\", \"holiday\", \"memory\", \"Christmas\"). The vocabulary is **adequate for the topic**, but lacks more **complex or varied language** to show a higher level of lexical resource.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Some specific vocabulary that is **relevant to the topic**, such as:\n  - \"origin\" (referring to cultural background)\n  - \"touch with my origin\" (a metaphorical expression)\n  - \"understand where we are going to go\" (use of idiomatic expression)\n\n**Limitations:**\n- There is **limited range of vocabulary**, with many repeated words (e.g., \"Sicily\", \"father\", \"I\", \"we\").\n- The vocabulary is **not very sophisticated** or varied for a Band 6.5+.\n- There are **some expressions that could be more idiomatic or natural** (e.g., \u201cfirst touch with my origin\u201d sounds awkward; it might be better phrased as \u201creconnecting with my roots\u201d).\n- The sentence structure and word choice sometimes feel **repetitive or simplistic**.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Accuracy of Vocabulary**\n\nThe answer **uses vocabulary correctly** in general, but there are a few **minor inaccuracies** or awkward phrasings:\n\n- **\"I have to make in my life\"**: The answer talks about **\u201ca big decision I had to make\u201d**, which is slightly off-topic as the question asks for a **decision**, not a **life event** (though the answer interprets it as a life decision, which is acceptable).\n- **\"I didn't enjoy much my relatives\"** \u2013 grammatically incorrect. Should be: \"I didn\u2019t enjoy being around my relatives much\" or \"I didn\u2019t enjoy being with my relatives much\".\n- **\"I would say, and how can I say\"** \u2013 this seems like a **filler phrase** or hesitation, not a vocabulary error, but can be distracting.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Appropriateness of Vocabulary**\n\nThe vocabulary used is **context-appropriate** for the topic (a personal life decision), but lacks the **nuance and complexity** expected for higher band scores (e.g., Band 6.5+ or above). There is room for more **idiomatic expressions**, **abstract vocabulary** (e.g., *heritage, identity, cultural background*), and **more sophisticated adjectives** to describe experiences (e.g., *nostalgic, enriching, significant*).\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation for Lexical Resource**\n\n- **Band 5.766** reflects:\n  - **Limited range of vocabulary**\n  - **Appropriate but simple vocabulary**\n  - **Minimal accuracy issues**, but with **some awkward or unclear phrasings**\n  - **Lack of sophisticated or idiomatic expressions**\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation for Improvement**\n\nTo improve **Lexical Resource** score, the candidate should:\n- Use **more specific and less common vocabulary** related to personal experiences, identity, and decisions.\n- Use **idiomatic expressions** (e.g., \u201creconnecting with my roots\u201d, \u201ca journey of self-discovery\u201d).\n- Use **more varied sentence structures** to demonstrate control over vocabulary.\n- Avoid **repetition** and **awkward phrasing** (e.g., \u201cfirst touch with my origin\u201d).\n- Use **higher-level adjectives and adverbs** to describe experiences and emotions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n- **Lexical Resource Band: 5.766**\n- **Reasonable range of vocabulary with some accuracy, but limited sophistication.**\n\nA **Band 6** would be more appropriate if the vocabulary was more varied and idiomatic, and if the grammatical errors were fewer."}

{"label": "Band score Lexical Resource: 5", "pred": "The answer provided for the IELTS Speaking Part 2 topic **\"Describe a festival in your country\"** is evaluated at a **CTTR of 4.95** in the **\"Lexical Resource\"** rubric. Below is an evaluation of the **Lexical Resource** component based on this answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Lexical Resource Evaluation: 4.95**\n\n**Band 5:**  \nThe candidate uses **basic vocabulary** to talk about the topic. However, there are **frequent lexical errors**, including **repetition**, **word choice inaccuracies**, and **ungrammatical expressions**.\n\n#### **Strengths:**\n- The candidate uses **some appropriate vocabulary** related to festivals (e.g., \"pancakes\", \"toppings\", \"amusement\", \"competitions\", \"music\", \"Maslenitsa\", \"symbol of the winter\").\n- The answer **attempts to use specific terms** that relate to the festival being described (e.g., Maslenitsa, burning a figure, celebration, pancakes).\n- There is **some coherence in vocabulary usage** regarding the description of the festival.\n\n#### **Weaknesses:**\n- **Lexical errors**: The candidate makes **repetitive use of words** (e.g., \"any any\", \"I don't know\", \"it it\"), which suggests **limited vocabulary range**.\n- **Word choice inaccuracies**: The answer includes phrases that are **not clearly expressed**, such as \u201cthe end of the winter or I don't know celebration,\u201d which shows a lack of precise vocabulary.\n- **Repetition of words and phrases**: Words such as \"celebration\" and \"people\" are repeated unnecessarily.\n- **Incorrect use of collocations or prepositions**: e.g., \u201cin the city\u201d, \u201cthe week before but at the weekend\u201d, \u201cburn the figure of the Maslenitsa.\u201d\n- **Spoken hesitation and fillers** (e.g., \"um\", \"I don't know\", \"you know\") are used excessively, which may not be directly related to the \"Lexical Resource\" rubric but impact **clarity and fluency** indirectly.\n- **Limited use of less common vocabulary** appropriate to the topic (e.g., cultural, traditional, symbolic, symbolic meaning, community gathering, etc.).\n- **Inconsistent use of vocabulary to express ideas clearly** (e.g., the description of the festival is somewhat unclear due to lexical imprecision).\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe answer shows **some appropriate vocabulary** related to festivals, but the **vocabulary is limited, repetitive, and imprecise**. The speaker **struggles to find suitable expressions** and relies heavily on **colloquial or hesitant language**. To improve the Lexical Resource score, the candidate should:\n\n- **Expand vocabulary** with more precise and specific terms related to festivals.\n- **Avoid repetition** and filler words.\n- **Use a wider range of vocabulary** to describe the festival more clearly and vividly.\n- **Improve sentence structure** and **collocational accuracy** (e.g., \u201csymbol of the winter\u201d could be \u201csymbolizing the end of winter\u201d).\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Lexical Band Score:**\n- **Band 5**: Limited vocabulary with frequent errors and repetition.\n- **Band 6**: Some range of vocabulary, with occasional errors.\n- **Band 7**: Good range of vocabulary with accurate use.\n- **Band 8/9**: Wide range of vocabulary, used precisely and appropriately.\n\n**This answer is likely to be at Band 5 for Lexical Resource**, consistent with the **CTTR of 4.95**."}
