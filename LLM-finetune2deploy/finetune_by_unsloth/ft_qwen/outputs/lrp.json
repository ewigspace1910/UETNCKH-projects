It's called Vitebskaya, and it's in the coolest neighborhood in St. Petersburg.\"**\n\n- **Lexical Resource:**  \n  \u2714\ufe0f The speaker uses **\"magnificent\"** and **\"coolest\"** \u2013 these are good, varied adjectives to describe a place.  \n  \u2714\ufe0f \"Neighborhood\" is a common term, but it\u2019s used correctly.  \n  \u2705 Overall, vocabulary is **appropriate and varied**, though some vocabulary could be more precise or diverse for a higher score.\n\n> **\"This is a great question, um, because, uh, actually we do not have many, um, opportunities to get to the city center very quickly from the area where I live, but I see it as an advantage, um, well, it makes the neighborhood quieter, and, um, I don't know, it, um, I walk more because of that.\"**\n\n- **Lexical Resource:**  \n  \u2705 The speaker uses **colloquial expressions** and **fillers** (\"um\", \"uh\", \"well\") which may reduce fluency but do not detract from **vocabulary choice**.  \n  \u2714\ufe0f There is use of **\"opportunities\"**, **\"advantage\"**, **\"quiet\"**, **\"walk more\"** \u2013 all are appropriate and show **basic vocabulary control**.  \n  \ud83d\udfe1 There is **some repetition** (\"um\") and **hesitation**, but the **range of vocabulary is acceptable for Band 6.5\u20137**. However, there\u2019s room to improve in **precision and diversity** of expression.\n\n> **\"Yeah, this is what I'm debating right now, to be honest. I've enjoyed living there, but I think it's essential to move, like, every three or four years. So I've lived there for two years and a half, so probably I should, yeah, should get going soon.\"**\n\n- **Lexical Resource:**  \n  \u2714\ufe0f Good use of phrases like **\"debating\"**, **\"essential\"**, **\"get going\"**, **\"should move\"**.  \n  \u2714\ufe0f The speaker is **able to express personal thoughts and experiences clearly**, which shows **adequate lexical control**.  \n  \ud83d\udfe1 Minor errors or **less idiomatic expressions** could be a concern, but **not severe**.\n\n#### **Overall Band for Lexical Resource (Part 1):**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **6.5\u20137** \u2013 Good lexical resource with some repetition and hesitation, but **sufficient range** and **accuracy**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Part 3 \u2013 Topic: School Trips\n\n#### **Answer Analysis:**\n\n> **\"Ah, with your school trip. Well, um, can I, can I tell about the university trip? So it was a hike. Um, we went to the mountains and we spent there four days. That was my first experience hiking and, uh, since then I've, I've really, um, yeah, I've done it a lot.\"**\n\n- **Lexical Resource:**  \n  \u2714\ufe0f Use of **\"hike\"**, **\"mountains\"**, **\"spend there\"**, **\"first experience\"**, **\"since then\"** \u2013 all are **appropriate** and show **basic understanding of vocabulary**.  \n  \ud83d\udfe1 However, **\"can I tell about the university trip\"** is a **colloquial and grammatically inaccurate expression** \u2013 but this is more related to **grammar**, not **lexical resource**.  \n  \ud83d\udfe1 **\"Spent there\"** is **awkward** in form but not necessarily a vocabulary issue.\n\n> **\"It was very well organized, I felt safe and I got all the equipment, all the instructions and also there were great people with us and great leaders.\"**\n\n- **Lexical Resource:**  \n  \u2705 Good use of **\"well organized\"**, **\"safe\"**, **\"equipment\"**, **\"instructions\"**, **\"great people\"** \u2013 **clear, appropriate vocabulary**.  \n  \u2714\ufe0f Vocabulary is **precise and contextual** \u2013 a good sign for Band 7+.\n\n> **\"I don't think so. I don't think my parents have ever been to the mountains because, um, that wasn't in Russia, that wasn't in this area, it was in America. So my school was, um, like located pretty much at the footstep of a mountain, and, uh, my parents did not study next to mountains, so no.\"**\n\n- **Lexical Resource:**  \n  \u2714\ufe0f Use of **\"located\"**, **\"footstep\"** (though **not commonly used**, it\u2019s understandable), **\"study\"** \u2013 these are all **contextually appropriate**.  \n  \ud83d\udfe1 The use of **\"footstep of a mountain\"** is slightly **uncommon**, but the **overall vocabulary is functional**.\n\n> **\"In Russian? Yeah, I think these days schools have more opportunities to take the schoolchildren abroad and I definitely don't think that was like a common practice at the time when my parents were children.\"**\n\n- **Lexical Resource:**  \n  \u2714\ufe0f Use of **\"opportunities\"**, **\"take abroad\"**, **\"common practice\"** \u2013 these are **accurate and appropriate**.  \n  \u2705 Shows **good range and flexibility of vocabulary** \u2013 suitable for a Band **7+** score.\n\n#### **Overall Band for Lexical Resource (Part 3):**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **7\u20137.5** \u2013 Vocabulary is **accurate and varied**, with **minimal issues**. The speaker uses **precise expressions** in context and shows a **good grasp of topic-related vocabulary**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Part 3 \u2013 Topic: Fashion\n\n#### **Answer Analysis:**\n\n> **\"Um, yes and no. I think sometimes when you don't pay too much attention to fashion, you just appear to be fashionable. But when you kind of give it a lot of thought, it kind of seems a little bit, um, too, how to say, too enforced?\"**\n\n- **Lexical Resource:**  \n  \u2714\ufe0f The speaker uses **\"fashionable\"**, **\"pay attention\"**, **\"enforced\"**, **\"too much thought\"** \u2013 these are **appropriate and creative**.  \n  \ud83d\udfe1 The speaker seems to be **struggling to find the right word** (\"how to say\") \u2013 but this is more about **fluency** and **speaking skills** than **lexical resource**.\n\n> **\"Um, some people may say so. Um, in St. Petersburg where I live, there are many trendy people and there are many, um, shopping malls and, I don't know, like designer boutiques where you can get, um, pretty like interesting clothes. Also, people buy clothes abroad.\"**\n\n- **Lexical Resource:**  \n  \u2714\ufe0f Use of **\"trendy\"**, **\"shopping malls\"**, **\"designer boutiques\"**, **\"get clothes\"** \u2013 all are **accurate and relevant**.  \n  \u2705 Good **variety of vocabulary related to fashion** \u2013 shows **strong lexical control**.\n\n> **\"Of course not I don't think so why not well look at I don't know look at some of the look at some of the businessmen who who we see yeah in the media I think they dress really really simply and make a point out of it.\"**\n\n- **Lexical Resource:**  \n  \ud83d\udfe1 The sentence is **disjointed**, but the vocabulary is **correct** \u2013 e.g., **\"businessmen\"**, **\"media\"**, **\"dressed simply\"**, **\"make a point out of it\"** \u2013 all are **accurate**.  \n  \ud83d\udfe1 The main issue here is **fluency and coherence**, not **vocabulary**.\n\n> **\"Absolutely, three stores rule.\"**\n\n- **Lexical Resource:**  \n  \u2705 **\"Three stores rule\"** is a colloquial expression and **easily understood**, though not very idiomatic. However, this is more about **fluency and speaking style** than **vocabulary**.\n\n#### **Overall Band for Lexical Resource (Part 3 \u2013 Fashion):**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **7\u20137.5** \u2013 Vocabulary is **accurate**, **varied**, and **used appropriately** in context.

{"label": "Band score Lexical Resource: 7", "pred": "Based on the **IELTS Speaking Part 1** answers provided and the rubric **\"Lexical Resource\"**, here is an **evaluation** of the candidate's lexical performance:\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Lexical Resource Score: 5.5 - 6.0**  \n*(Based on the CTTR of 5.978, which is a lexical diversity score, and the content of the answers)*\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations for \"Lexical Resource\" (Band 6)**\n\n#### \u2705 **Strengths:**\n1. **Appropriate vocabulary for the topic:**  \n   The candidate uses a range of vocabulary related to travel (e.g. \"interesting places\", \"different ways of thinking\", \"peaceful feeling\", \"fresh air\") and food (e.g. \"Mediterranean food\", \"paella\", \"tapas\", \"service\", \"presentation\").\n\n2. **Ability to express opinions and preferences:**  \n   They successfully use expressions such as \"I really love\", \"I really appreciate\", \"I think that\", and \"I have to say\" which show understanding of how to express opinions.\n\n3. **Some specific and descriptive language:**  \n   Words like \"fascinating\", \"different ways of thinking\", \"peaceful feeling\", and \"huge parks\" are more descriptive and show some effort to vary vocabulary.\n\n4. **Basic use of adjectives and adverbs:**  \n   The candidate uses adjectives such as \"really fascinating\", \"completely different\", and \"huge\" to describe experiences.\n\n---\n\n#### \u26a0\ufe0f **Weaknesses:**\n1. **Repetition and limited range of vocabulary:**  \n   - The candidate frequently uses the phrase **\"I have to say\"** and **\"I really\"** which reduces the variety of vocabulary.\n   - Overuse of phrases like **\"you know\"**, **\"you don't appreciate\"**, **\"you can just see\"** suggests a limited lexical range.\n   - Repeats phrases like **\"different ways of thinking\"** and **\"peaceful feeling\"** without variation.\n\n2. **Grammatical errors affect lexical accuracy:**  \n   - The answers contain **grammatical errors**, which often interfere with meaning. For example:\n     - *\"I will love to visit Japan because I really appreciate the culture they speak me really well...\"* \u2013 unclear and non-native grammar.\n     - *\"I do prefer the countryside to be honest but nowadays it's really difficult to live in there I mean...\"* \u2013 run-on sentences and lack of punctuation.\n\n3. **Lack of idiomatic and idiomatic expressions:**  \n   - The candidate uses basic, non-idiomatic expressions. There is little use of collocations or natural phrases in English.\n\n4. **Overuse of filler words:**  \n   - Words like **\"you know\"**, **\"I mean\"**, and **\"to be honest\"** are used excessively and reduce the lexical effectiveness of the answers.\n\n5. **Inconsistent use of vocabulary for food topic:**  \n   - The vocabulary related to food is somewhat limited, with some repetition (e.g. **\"seafood\", \"fish\", \"tapas\"**).  \n   - Phrases like **\"we eat lots of seafood\"** and **\"we have a lot of lobster\"** could be rephrased more fluently.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement:**\n- **Increase vocabulary range:** Use synonyms (e.g. \"fascinating\" \u2192 \"intriguing\", \"interesting\" \u2192 \"engaging\").\n- **Avoid repetition and filler words.** Use linking devices (e.g. \"however\", \"moreover\", \"in addition\").\n- **Improve grammar and sentence structure.** This will enhance the clarity of the vocabulary used.\n- **Use more collocations and idioms related to travel and food** (e.g. \"get lost in a foreign city\", \"have a taste of local cuisine\", \"a vibrant food scene\").\n- **Practice more descriptive language** to enhance the quality of the vocabulary used in speaking.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe candidate shows some ability to use appropriate vocabulary for the topics, but there is a **lack of variety and accuracy**. The **lexical resource is at Band 5.5 - 6.0 level**, depending on how much weight is given to the CTTR and how effectively vocabulary is used in the speaking test.\n\nTo improve, focus on **vocabulary development, grammar accuracy, and fluency**, as these are closely linked to lexical resource in IELTS speaking."}

Some words may be used inappropriately or with imprecise use.\n- **Band 6**: Uses vocabulary that is limited in range and sometimes repetitive. There may be some errors in word choice.\n- **Band 5 or below**: Uses a limited range of vocabulary with frequent errors in word choice and collocation.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Lexical Resource:**\n\n#### **1. Topic: Study**\n\n**Answer:**\n> \"I'm studying MSc Marketing. Oh, because analytics is big now, big data is everywhere, and I had previous experience in SQL, so I decided to come here and study analytics.\"\n\n- **Vocabulary used:** *analytics, big data, SQL, study, experience, opportunity, data science, data analytics, etc.*\n- **Evaluation:** The speaker uses relevant academic vocabulary related to data and technology (SQL, analytics, data science). However, the use of phrases like *\"big now\"* and *\"I had previous experience in SQL\"* shows some **imprecise word choice** or **repetition** of phrases such as \"big data is everywhere.\"\n- The term *\"I decided to come here\"* is colloquial and could be replaced with a more formal expression like *\"I chose to pursue this program here.\"*\n\n**Answer continuation:**\n> \"Oh I hope to work as a data scientist... this degree gives me the opportunity to study it in more detail than I knew previously...\"\n\n- **Evaluation:** Repetition of *\u201cI knew previously\u201d* shows **limited lexical variety**. Also, *\u201cin more detail than I knew previously\u201d* is **awkward phrasing** and not idiomatic. The speaker could use more formal alternatives like *\u201cin greater depth\u201d* or *\u201cto gain a deeper understanding.\u201d*\n\n**Lexical Resource Score (Study):** **6.5**\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Topic: Free Time**\n\n**Answer:**\n> \"This is a past year I haven't really had too much free time... I also volunteer during the weekends.\"\n\n- **Evaluation:** The phrase *\"This is a past year\"* is unclear \u2013 should be *\"This past year\"* or *\"In the past year.\"* The speaker uses *\"too much free time\"* which is acceptable but could be improved with more varied expressions like *\"a lot of leisure time\"* or *\"personal time.\"* Also, *\"I also volunteer\"* is **repetitive** \u2013 could use *\u201cI also participate in voluntary work\u201d* or *\u201cI also give my time to volunteering.\u201d*\n\n**Answer:**\n> \"It depends on the weather... I would like to go outside rather than stay in my room.\"\n\n- **Evaluation:** This answer is clear and shows reasonable vocabulary, though slightly informal. However, phrases like *\"I would like to go outside rather than stay in my room\"* could be more natural or varied, e.g., *\"I prefer to be outdoors instead of indoors.\"*\n\n**Answer:**\n> \"Oh, I used to read a lot... I used to get scolded a lot by my parents like go out and play with kids your age...\"\n\n- **Evaluation:** The use of *\u201cused to\u201d* is correct, but the sentence *\"I used to get scolded a lot by my parents like go out and play with kids your age\"* is **awkward** and has **collocation issues** (should be *\"I used to get scolded by my parents for not going out and playing with kids your age\"*). This shows **imprecise vocabulary use** and **repetition of \"used to.\"**\n\n**Answer:**\n> \"Oh, this weekend like I said I volunteer... I would be going visiting patients and providing counseling to them.\"\n\n- **Evaluation:** *\u201cI would be going visiting patients\u201d* is **incorrect collocation** \u2013 should be *\u201cI will be visiting patients\u201d* or *\u201cI will be going to visit patients.\u201d* The phrase *\"providing counseling to them\"* is correct, but could be more natural as *\"providing emotional support\" or \"offering counseling services.\"*\n\n**Lexical Resource Score (Free Time):** **6.0**\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Topic: Travel**\n\n**Answer:**\n> \"Yes, I do. Because I like, like, getting to know other countries... stuff like that. It's interesting to me.\"\n\n- **Evaluation:** The repeated use of *\u201clike\u201d* and *\u201cstuff like that\u201d* shows **limited vocabulary and informal speech**. The phrase *\u201cgetting to know other countries\u201d* is clear but somewhat repetitive. Could be more idiomatic: *\u201cI enjoy discovering new cultures and learning about how people live in different parts of the world.\u201d*\n\n**Answer:**\n> \"Oh, in my country people mostly like to go to Europe... it's like a pleasant change for them so most of us would like to go to America or anywhere in the Europe where it's colder.\"\n\n- **Evaluation:** There are **repetitions** (e.g., \u201cEurope\u201d used twice), and some **awkward collocations** such as *\"it's like a pleasant change for them.\"* The speaker could express this more naturally: *\"It\u2019s a refreshing change for them.\"*\n\n**Answer:**\n> \"Oh yes it is. It is quite popular... I think movies have a huge role to play in it...\"\n\n- **Evaluation:** The speaker uses *\u201chave a huge role to play\u201d* \u2013 which is acceptable but **overused**. Also, the sentence *\"people mostly go travel during the summer\"* is incorrect \u2013 it should be *\"people mostly go travelling during the summer.\"*\n\n**Answer:**\n> \"Oh, uh, there are still a lot of places in India that I haven't seen... Bali, so Bali and Greece, yes.\"\n\n- **Evaluation:** The phrase *\"I haven't seen\"* could be more formal as *\"I haven't visited.\"* Also, *\"Bali, so Bali and Greece\"* is **awkward phrasing** and lacks coherence. The speaker could say *\"places like Bali and Greece.\"*\n\n**Lexical Resource Score (Travel):** **6.5**\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Lexical Resource Score:**\n\n- **Study:** 6.5  \n- **Free Time:** 6.0  \n- **Travel:** 6.5  \n- **Average:** **6.3**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe candidate shows **some understanding of academic and everyday vocabulary**, particularly related to studying, free time, and travel. However, there are **repetitions, imprecise word choice, and awkward collocations** that affect the clarity and fluency of the answers.\n\nTo improve **Lexical Resource** score, the candidate should:\n- Expand vocabulary and avoid overused expressions like *\"like,\" \"stuff like that,\" \"used to.\"*\n- Use more **accurate and varied vocabulary** and **idiomatic expressions.**\n- Improve **collocations** and **sentence structure** for better fluency and clarity.\n\n--- \n\n**Final Lexical Resource Band Score: 6.3 (out of 9)**  \n**CTTR: 7.116** \u2013 this is likely a calculated average including other criteria (fluency, grammar, pronunciation). The **Lexical Resource** score of **6.3** is consistent with a low- to mid-6.5 band overall."}

Below is a detailed breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Strengths:**\n\n1. **Basic Vocabulary Used to Express Ideas:**\n   - The candidate can identify and describe types of food (e.g. *dim sum, fajita, pizza, burger*), and can express simple reasons (e.g. *it's delicious, traditional, spicy*).\n   - In the **Friends** section, the candidate can describe activities (e.g. *go to cinema, watch film, have dinner*), and can express ideas about what a good friend is (e.g. *support each other*).\n\n2. **Some Collocations:**\n   - There are attempts to use some collocations, such as *national food*, *spicy food*, *text my phone*, *come from Shenzhen*.\n\n---\n\n### **Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Limited Range of Vocabulary:**\n   - The candidate uses **very repetitive vocabulary** and **basic, often overused words**, e.g. *like, eat, food, cook, restaurant, friends, talk, help*.\n   - There is **very little use of specialized or varied vocabulary** that could better express their ideas clearly or more precisely.\n\n2. **Frequent Grammatical Errors That Impact Lexical Resource:**\n   - While this is more of a **grammar** issue, it\u2019s important for **lexical resource** because incorrect word usage or collocations due to grammar issues can lower the score.\n   - For example:\n     - \"I'm interesting in Mexican food\" \u279d should be *interested in*.\n     - \"I'm interested with these national dishes\" \u279d should be *interested in*.\n     - \"I didn't like to cooking\" \u279d should be *didn\u2019t like cooking* or *don\u2019t like cooking*.\n     - \"There's a benefit at home\" \u279d unclear or awkward phrasing.\n\n3. **Repetition of Words and Phrases:**\n   - The candidate **repeats phrases** such as *I like, I think, I prefer, I don't like* throughout the answers.\n   - Overuse of *like, eat, food, restaurant, friends* suggests **limited vocabulary range**.\n\n4. **Lack of Sophisticated Expressions:**\n   - The candidate does **not use any advanced or varied vocabulary** to express more complex ideas.\n   - For example, instead of saying \"I like the spicy food\", a more nuanced expression could be *\"I enjoy the spiciness of Mexican cuisine\"*.\n\n---\n\n### **Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Expand Vocabulary Range:**\n   - Learn and use synonyms (e.g. instead of \u201cfood\u201d, use *meals, cuisine, dishes*).\n   - Learn more specific terms (e.g. instead of \u201cspicy\u201d, use *spicy, hot, piquant, zesty*).\n\n2. **Improve Collocation Knowledge:**\n   - Practice collocations such as:\n     - *be interested in something*\n     - *cook for yourself / cook at home*\n     - *support each other*\n     - *keep in contact with someone*\n\n3. **Use More Advanced Expressions:**\n   - Try to use expressions like:\n     - *I\u2019m really curious about* instead of *I\u2019m interested in*.\n     - *I\u2019d love to try* instead of *I would like to try*.\n     - *It\u2019s beneficial to* instead of *there\u2019s a benefit at home*.\n\n4. **Avoid Repetition:**\n   - Vary sentence structures and vocabulary to avoid sounding monotonous.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment (Lexical Resource):**\n\n- **Band Score: 5.5 - 6.0**\n- **Reasoning:**\n  - The candidate shows **basic vocabulary** and **some ability to express ideas**.\n  - However, vocabulary is **limited and repetitive**, and there are **frequent errors in collocations and word choice**.\n  - With more practice in **using varied and accurate vocabulary**, the candidate can achieve a **Band 6.5 or higher**.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a **model answer with improved lexical resource** for comparison?"}

I actually want to know first when I tell this. Maybe in kind of furniture and put it some another day.\"\n- \"I'm actually planning to move on another country. Yeah, maybe.\"\n\n#### **Lexical Resource Evaluation:**\n- **Range of vocabulary**: Very limited. The speaker uses simple and sometimes incorrect expressions (e.g., \"a lot of many changes\", \"move on another country\", \"put it some another day\").\n- **Accuracy**: There are several **lexical errors**, such as \"move on another country\" (should be \"move to another country\"), \"put it some another day\" (should be \"put it on another day\"), and \"a lot of many changes\" (repetition and incorrect collocation).\n- **Word choice**: Limited vocabulary; the speaker struggles to express ideas clearly, often using phrases that are not idiomatic or correct.\n- **Appropriateness**: The vocabulary is not always appropriate for the topic; the speaker lacks fluency and coherence in expressing ideas.\n\n#### **Score Estimate: 5.0 - 5.5**  \n*(Depending on whether the errors are due to language limitations or lack of preparation.

Yes, ten friends.\"*  \n- **Lexical Resource Evaluation:**  \n  - **Score:** 4.0  \n  - The answer is simple and uses basic vocabulary. The candidate repeats \"yes\" unnecessarily and says \"ten friends\" instead of using more natural expressions like \"around ten\" or \"I have about ten friends.\"  \n  - **Weakness:** Limited vocabulary range and lack of fluency in expressing numbers in context.

I prefer visiting...\", \"I feel that...\"), which can reduce the **lexical complexity**.\n\n5. **Occasional Errors in Lexical Choice:**\n   - There are minor issues with **word choice or collocation**, such as \"it's kind of hard sometimes to kids to go to university\" \u2013 the structure is a bit awkward and could be more clearly expressed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation of Lexical Resource:**\n\n- **Band Score Estimate (Lexical Resource): 6.0 \u2013 6.5**\n  - The candidate shows **basic lexical competence**, with the ability to use vocabulary appropriate to the topic.\n  - However, there is **limited range and precision**, and **repetition of basic vocabulary** reduces the lexical richness.\n  - If the candidate had used **more precise, varied, and topic-appropriate vocabulary** with **greater accuracy**, the band score could have been in the **6.5 range or higher**.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Expand Vocabulary:**\n   - Use more varied and **accurate vocabulary** (e.g., \"public education system\", \"academic institutions\", \"cultural immersion\", \"tourist attractions\", \"historical landmarks\", \"socio-cultural aspects\").\n\n2. **Avoid Repeating Words:**\n   - Replace repeated words like \"really\", \"like\", \"place\", and \"people\" with **synonyms** or **more descriptive phrases**.\n\n3. **Use More Complex Noun Phrases:**\n   - Use phrases such as \"educational opportunities\", \"cultural immersion\", \"technological advancements\", or \"urban exploration\" to enhance lexical richness.\n\n4. **Reduce Colloquial Language:**\n   - Replace informal expressions like \"you know\", \"like\", and \"yeah\" with more formal and **standard English expressions**.\n\n5. **Practice Topic-Related Expressions:**\n   - Familiarize yourself with **academic and topic-specific vocabulary** related to \"education\" and \"travelling\" to improve lexical resource.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\n- **Lexical Resource Band Estimate: 6.2 (approx.)**\n- The candidate uses **basic, functional vocabulary**, with **some variety**, but lacks the **range and sophistication** needed for a higher band. With **more precise vocabulary and fewer repetitions**, they could achieve a **Band 6.5 or higher** in this criterion."}

Vocabulary Accuracy**\n\n- **Strengths:**\n  - The speaker uses **mostly accurate vocabulary** with **very few errors**, suggesting that the speaker has a **good grasp** of vocabulary in general.\n  - The responses are **grammatically clear**, even if the delivery is halting at times.\n\n- **Weaknesses:**\n  - There are occasional **colloquial expressions** and **non-idiomatic phrasing** that make the language seem **less formal** and **less academic** than expected at the IELTS Band 7 or 8 level.\n  - **Some phrases are vague or unclear**, such as *\u201cwe\u2019re also missing something with using our memory less\u201d*, which is **not well-explained**, reducing clarity.\n  - There is **overuse of hesitation markers** (*um, uh, yeah, I mean, you know, I think, like*) that can make the responses **sound less natural and less fluent**, even if the vocabulary is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation for Lexical Resource: Band 6.5 (Approximate)**\n\n| Category | Score | Explanation |\n|--------|--------|-------------|\n| **Vocabulary Range** | 6 | Moderate range with repetition and limited use of abstract or academic vocabulary. |\n| **Vocabulary Accuracy** | 7 | Fewer errors, but the language is somewhat informal and lacks precision in expressing abstract ideas. |\n| **Overall Lexical Resource** | **6.5** | The vocabulary is **adequate** and **clear**, but the speaker shows limited range and uses simpler, less precise language than expected for a higher band score. There is also overuse of hesitation markers and informal expressions that affect fluency and clarity. |\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n- **Increase vocabulary range** by learning and using **more advanced or academic words** to describe abstract ideas (e.g., *cognitive decline, memory retention, technological dependency, habit formation, temporal awareness*).\n- **Avoid colloquial expressions** and **hesitation fillers** (*um, uh, like, you know*) to sound more confident and fluent.\n- Practice **clarity and precision** in expressing complex ideas, especially when discussing topics like *forgetfulness*, *technology*, and *aging*.\n- Use **more specific collocations** and **phrases** to express ideas with more fluency and sophistication.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Banding: 6.5 for Lexical Resource**\n\nThis score reflects the speaker\u2019s **adequate vocabulary knowledge**, **reasonable accuracy**, and **some limitations** in range and fluency.

Below is a breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **Strengths:**\n\n1. **Appropriate vocabulary for topic:**\n   - The candidate uses vocabulary that is relevant to the topics \"Traditional Handmade Items\" and \"Manufactured Goods,\" such as:\n     - *sense of pride, fulfilling, handmade, mass production, aesthetic, atmosphere, personality, dystopian future.*\n   - These terms are appropriate and show understanding of the themes in the questions.\n\n2. **Use of collocations:**\n   - The candidate occasionally uses collocations that reflect understanding of the topic, such as:\n     - *mass produced scarf, handmade scarf, sense of personality, middle road, sense of pride.*\n   - These are correctly used in context, showing some ability to use expressions beyond single words.\n\n3. **Use of synonyms:**\n   - The candidate uses some synonyms to avoid repetition, such as:\n     - *handmade* vs *mass produced, store-bought, factory-made.*\n     - *items* vs *goods, products, things.*\n\n4. **Use of discourse markers:**\n   - The candidate uses some linking phrases and discourse markers to join ideas, e.g.:\n     - *I think, I feel like, it\u2019s quite important that, I think that...*\n   - These help structure the response and support coherence (though coherence is not the focus here).\n\n---\n\n### **Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Lack of precise vocabulary:**\n   - The vocabulary is often simple or vague, and lacks precision. For example:\n     - *\u201cI think the most popular would be homemade decorations for holidays\u201d* \u2013 the candidate uses the vague term *\u201chomemade\u201d* without a specific descriptor or context.\n     - The phrase *\"little, almost little decorations\"* is unclear and grammatically awkward.\n\n2. **Repetition and lack of range:**\n   - The candidate repeats the same structures and vocabulary:\n     - *\u201cI think\u201d* is used too frequently.\n     - Words like *\u201cthing\u201d*, *\u201citem\u201d*, *\u201cgood\u201d*, *\u201cproduct\u201d* are repeated without sufficient variety.\n\n3. **Overuse of fillers:**\n   - The candidate uses many fillers and hesitation devices such as:\n     - *\u201cum, uh, you know, I think, I feel like, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed feeling one...\u201d*\n   - These can affect fluency and make the vocabulary seem less controlled or varied.\n\n4. **Some lexical errors:**\n   - There are minor errors or awkward phrasing, such as:\n     - *\u201cI think with the internet and ordering online and mass production it\u2019s quite important that people keep doing things themselves it\u2019s it brings a sense of personality in it.\u201d* \u2013 This sentence is not well-structured and could be clearer with better punctuation or sentence structure.\n     - *\u201cthere\u2019ll be lots of robots making things the one moment, and then maybe they\u2019ll go back to things being made by hand.\u201d* \u2013 The phrasing is awkward and unclear.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe candidate has a **reasonably good range of vocabulary** for a Band 7\u20137.5, but the vocabulary is **not consistently precise or varied**, and there are **some lexical errors and repetitions** that prevent reaching a Band 8 or higher. The vocabulary is sufficient to **convey the required meaning**, but it lacks the **depth and fluency** expected for a higher band.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Band for Lexical Resource: Band 7.0\u20137.2**  \n**CTTR of 7.153** is consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n- Expand vocabulary by learning more specific terms related to crafts, manufacturing, technology, and economics.\n- Avoid repeating the same words and phrases.\n- Reduce the use of filler words (e.g. *um, uh, I think, you know*) to sound more fluent and confident.\n- Practice organizing ideas more clearly and using more complex and varied sentence structures."}

Does food play an important role in your culture?**\n**Answer:**\n> \"Yes, I think it does. When we have family get-togethers, there's always a lot of food, and we have a big meal when we celebrate religious holidays. I guess that's the same in most countries. Food usually is connected to big cultural or religious festivals.\"\n\n**Lexical Resource Assessment:**\n- **Vocabulary**: Uses vocabulary related to culture, celebrations, and traditions (e.g., \u201creligious holidays\u201d, \u201ccultural festivals\u201d).\n- **Variety**: Fairly good, with some specific terms used.\n- **Accuracy**: Vocabulary is accurate and used appropriately.\n- **Range**: Moderate range, with some specific cultural terms.\n\n**Score Estimate (Lexical Resource):** **6.0 - 6.5**\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Would you say people in your country have a healthy diet these days, or did people eat more healthily in the past?**\n**Answer:**\n> \"That's a difficult question. I think both diets could be healthy. You see, traditionally in Germany, people ate quite plain food like potatoes, meat, and bread, but they ate vegetables too, so in my view, I think the diet was quite healthy. And now our society is so multicultural, especially in the cities, that we have many other cuisines to choose from, such as Indian or Turkish, so we can have a varied healthy diet.

{"label": "Band score Lexical Resource: 9", "pred": "The answer provided for the IELTS Speaking Part 3 section on the topic of \"Attitudes to gift\" and its commercial aspect shows a **strong lexical resource** with **some room for improvement**, particularly in terms of vocabulary range, precision, and consistency. Based on the IELTS rubric for **Lexical Resource**, the following evaluation is made:\n\n---\n\n### **Lexical Resource Evaluation: 7.5 (Band 7.5)**\n\n#### **Strengths:**\n\n1. **Appropriate and varied vocabulary:**\n   - The speaker uses a wide range of vocabulary related to the topic, such as \"treasure,\" \"edible,\" \"chutneys,\" \"permeate,\" \"commercialized,\" \"hobbies,\" \"gadgets,\" and \"commercialized.\" This demonstrates a good command of topic-related vocabulary.\n\n2. **Use of collocations and phrasal verbs:**\n   - The response includes correct and natural collocations such as \"spend time thinking about,\" \"treasure it,\" \"fill our hearts with joy,\" and \"sense that it has been bought out of haste.\"\n\n3. **Use of conditional and complex sentence structures:**\n   - The speaker uses complex sentences with conditionals like \"if someone receives a gift...\" and \"if we have found the perfect gift...\" which shows the ability to express nuanced ideas.\n\n4. **Use of idiomatic expressions and metaphors:**\n   - Expressions like \"the thought that counts\" and \"fill our hearts with joy\" add natural fluency and show the speaker's ability to use idiomatic language appropriately.\n\n5. **Use of formal and informal registers as appropriate:**\n   - The speaker maintains a formal and academic tone appropriate for Part 3, using expressions like \"In my opinion,\" \"I think,\" \"Of course,\" \"It\u2019s no good,\" and so on.\n\n---\n\n#### **Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Limited vocabulary depth in some areas:**\n   - While the speaker uses a decent range of vocabulary, some areas could show more depth. For example, when discussing the commercialization of festivals, the language is straightforward and lacks more sophisticated or nuanced expressions (e.g., \u201ccommercialized\u201d is used but could be expanded with terms like \"commodified,\" \"consumer-driven,\" or \"market-oriented\").\n\n2. **Overuse of repetition:**\n   - The word \u201cgift\u201d is used multiple times without sufficient variation (e.g., \"gift,\" \"present,\" \"present buying,\" \"buying gifts\"). Though not incorrect, more varied synonyms could enhance lexical resource.\n\n3. **Some phrases are overly simple or clich\u00e9:**\n   - Expressions like \"the thought that counts\" and \"fill our hearts with joy\" are common and, while natural, may not demonstrate a high level of lexical sophistication.\n\n4. **Limited use of technical or academic vocabulary:**\n   - The answer could benefit from more advanced vocabulary related to psychology, economics, or sociology of gifting (e.g., \u201cconsumer behavior,\u201d \u201csymbolic exchange,\u201d \u201csociocultural value,\u201d \u201ccognitive dissonance,\u201d etc.).\n\n---\n\n#### **Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe answer demonstrates a **good command of vocabulary** and uses it appropriately, with **some repetition and lack of sophistication** in specific areas. The speaker shows the ability to express ideas clearly and coherently, but for a Band 8+, they would need to:\n\n- Use a broader and more sophisticated range of vocabulary\n- Avoid repetition of key terms\n- Incorporate more idiomatic, academic, or specialized expressions\n- Use more complex and varied sentence structures\n\n---\n\n### **Band Estimate Based on Lexical Resource: 7.5**\n\n- **Band 7.5** \u2013 Good range of vocabulary with some repetition and limited use of more advanced or idiomatic expressions.\n- **Band 8.0** \u2013 Would require more advanced vocabulary, better range, and more precise expression of ideas.\n- **Band 7.0** \u2013 Would require less variety, more repetition, and simpler expression of ideas.\n\n---\n\n### **Suggested Improvements for a Higher Band:**\n\n- Replace repetitive terms like \"gift\" with synonyms: \"present,\" \"token,\" \"memento,\" \"token of appreciation,\" etc.\n- Use more advanced vocabulary: \"commodified,\" \"consumer-driven,\" \"sociocultural value,\" \"symbolic value,\" \"cognitive dissonance.\"\n- Introduce complex phrases: \"The intrinsic value of a gift lies not in its material worth but in its sentimental and relational significance.\"\n- Vary sentence structures to avoid repetition of subject + verb + object patterns.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Verdict:**\n**Lexical Resource: Band 7.5 (with potential for Band 8.0 with refinement)**  \n**Overall Band Score: 7.951 (as per CTTR) \u2013 consistent with a strong performance in all four criteria.**"}

These terms are accurate and relevant to the topic.\n   - In the **work clothes** section, terms like *image*, *perspective*, *formal*, *casual*, *work ethic*, *contribute*, and *refreshing change* are effectively used and clearly express the speaker\u2019s ideas.\n\n2. **Collocation and word choice:**\n   - Phrases like *social status attached to it*, *flaunt your affluence*, *build up perspectives*, *trained to dress*, and *work ethic* demonstrate a reasonable level of **collocational accuracy**.\n\n3. **Use of idiomatic expressions:**\n   - The speaker occasionally uses informal collocations and phrases like *I think so*, *you can flaunt your affluence that way*, and *you don't feel like you're forced to do it* \u2014 which are common in spoken English and contribute to natural expression.\n\n---\n\n### **Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Limited range of vocabulary:**\n   - There is repetition of certain phrases (e.g., *I think*, *I think so*, *I think it's because of that*), which limits the speaker's lexical variety.\n   - In the **work clothes** section, the speaker uses **redundant and repetitive phrasing** such as:\n     - *\u201cI think...\u201d* (used multiple times)\n     - *\u201cit\u2019s a tricky one\u201d*, *\u201cyou don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re forced\u201d*, *\u201cwe should make that decision by ourselves\u201d* \u2013 these are repetitive and do not demonstrate a wide vocabulary range.\n\n2. **Lack of sophistication or precise terminology:**\n   - The language is **basic and somewhat informal** in some areas.

These do not contribute to lexical richness but rather suggest **uncertainty** in vocabulary selection.\n\n4. **Inconsistent word choice and phrasing:**\n   - Phrases like *\u201cyou can flaunt your affluence that way\u201d* \u2013 while understandable, is **not a common collocation** and might be seen as overly informal or overly simplified.\n   - In the work clothes section, phrases like *\u201ccompanies like Google have made it really popular to where like engineers...\u201d* are **awkwardly phrased**, indicating **limited ability to construct complex sentence structures** with **accurate vocabulary**.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment for Lexical Resource:**\n- **Band Score: 6.214** is a reasonable score, reflecting the speaker\u2019s ability to **communicate basic ideas with reasonably accurate vocabulary**, but limited by:\n  - **Repetition of phrases**\n  - **Overuse of \u201cI think\u201d**\n  - **Informal and hesitant language**\n  - **Lack of sophisticated vocabulary or precise terminology**\n  - **Hesitation and filler words affecting lexical fluency**\n\n---\n\n### **Suggestions for Improvement:**\n- Use **more varied expressions** to convey the same ideas (e.g., instead of *\u201cI think\u201d* every time, use *\u201cFrom my perspective,\u201d* *\u201cIn my view,\u201d*, or *\u201cOne might argue that\u2026\u201d*)\n- Increase the use of **precise and formal vocabulary** in Part 3 (e.g., *\u201csocioeconomic status,\u201d* *\u201cclass stratification,\u201d* *\u201cprofessional attire,\u201d* *\u201cformal corporate culture\u201d*)\n- Avoid **filler words** and repetition to enhance clarity and fluency.\n- Practice using **idiomatic expressions and collocations** that are appropriate for academic or semi-formal speaking (e.g., *\u201cconvey social status,\u201d* *\u201cexhibit one\u2019s affluence,\u201d* *\u201cdemonstrate professionalism\u201d*)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe speaker demonstrates **basic lexical competence** and can express ideas clearly on the given topics. However, the **limited range of vocabulary, repetitive phrasing, and informal expressions** prevent the speaker from achieving a higher band in Lexical Resource. With more focus on **lexical variety, precision, and fluency**, the band score could be improved."}

{"label": "Band score Lexical Resource: 7", "pred": "Based on the provided answers and the IELTS Speaking test **\"Lexical Resource\"** rubric, here is an **evaluation of lexical resource** (word choice and use of vocabulary) for the answers given in **Part 3** of the IELTS Speaking test. The band score is **6.311**, which corresponds roughly to a **Band 6.5** in IELTS speaking (based on the overall score, though we are evaluating only one of the four criteria here). Below is a breakdown of the **lexical resource** based on the rubric:\n\n---\n\n### **Band Score Criteria (Lexical Resource)**\n\n- **Band 9:** Uses a wide range of vocabulary with **precise and accurate** use of idiomatic expressions and phrasal verbs.\n- **Band 8:** Uses **a wide range of vocabulary** with **some accurate use of idiomatic expressions**.\n- **Band 7:** Uses **a good range of vocabulary** appropriate to the task, with **some repetition** of vocabulary.\n- **Band 6.5:** Uses **a limited range of vocabulary** with **some repetition**, and **occasional inaccuracies or inappropriate word choice**.\n- **Band 6:** Uses **limited vocabulary** with **frequent repetition** and **inappropriate or inaccurate** use of vocabulary.\n- **Band 5:** Uses **very limited vocabulary** with **many errors** in word choice and **inappropriate use of collocations**.\n- **Band 4 or below:** Uses **basic vocabulary** with **many errors** and **poor use of vocabulary**.\n\n---\n\n### **Lexical Resource Evaluation for \"Hobbies and Interests\" Answers**\n\n**Answer 1:**\n> \"Do you think having a hobby is a benefit for people's social lives?\"  \n> \"Yes, I think so. Yeah, it have benefit. It's good for health and, um, if you play football, you can do a lot of exercise. You, you, you do it with people, with friends. Play football, um, other people, other teams, you must, um, play each other and help win. So, good relationship.\"\n\n- **Vocabulary used:** Basic and repetitive (e.g., \"you, you, you\", \"um\", \"play\", \"help win\", \"good relationship\").\n- **Accuracy:** \"It have benefit\" is grammatically incorrect (should be \"it has benefits\" or \"it is beneficial\").\n- **Range:** Very limited. Repetition of simple terms like \"play football\", \"help win\", etc.\n- **Conclusion:** Limited vocabulary with frequent repetition and grammatical errors. Suggests **Band 5\u20136** in Lexical Resource.\n\n**Answer 2:**\n> \"Are there any disadvantages of spending too much time doing a hobby?\"  \n> \"Yes, actually, um, um, if you do a lot of time on football or hobby, um, you will waste your time. Its advantage will be disadvantage. And if you have too much time, you will lose your work. So you, you, you late for work and, um, your boss is angry.\"\n\n- **Vocabulary used:** Again repetitive (\"you, you, you\", \"um\"), and some basic expressions.\n- **Accuracy:** \"Its advantage will be disadvantage\" is awkward phrasing. \"You will lose your work\" is unclear; perhaps \"you\u2019ll neglect your work\".\n- **Range:** Very limited, again focusing on a single example (football) and repetitive phrasing.\n- **Conclusion:** Same issues as above. Again, **Band 5\u20136** in Lexical Resource.\n\n**Answer 3:**\n> \"Why do you think it's important to have a hobby and why?\"  \n> \"To make life interesting, um, without your hobby your life will be very boring and not interesting. You need something else, you just go to college and go home and go to work, it's, that's not good life. Because important to try new things, to, to exercise, to, to learn things, and, um, not just work and sleep only.\"\n\n- **Vocabulary used:** Still basic (\"boring\", \"not interesting\", \"try new things\", \"exercise\", \"learn things\").\n- **Accuracy:** \"Because important\" is grammatically incorrect (should be \"Because it is important\").\n- **Range:** Slightly more varied, but still very basic and repetitive in structure.\n- **Conclusion:** Limited vocabulary with occasional inaccuracies and repetition. **Band 6** in Lexical Resource.\n\n---\n\n### **Lexical Resource Evaluation for \"Leisure Time\" Answers**\n\n**Answer 1:**\n> \"In your country, do people have a lot of leisure time?\"  \n> \"It depend, some companies are very loose so you have too much time for your leisure time, but some companies are very strict, you have to work very long hours and you have no time for anything else, you just sleep.\"\n\n- **Vocabulary used:** Basic, repetitive (\"you have too much time\", \"you have to work long hours\").\n- **Accuracy:** \"It depend\" is incorrect (should be \"It depends\").\n- **Range:** Limited vocabulary, with minimal variation.\n- **Conclusion:** Limited vocabulary and grammatical errors. **Band 5\u20136** in Lexical Resource.\n\n**Answer 2:**\n> \"Do you think people in your country have good work life balance and why?\"  \n> \"Um, only if you work in those good companies, I suppose. Because some companies very strict, you have to work long hours, but other companies only small hours and many holidays.\"\n\n- **Vocabulary used:** Still basic. Repetition of \"you have to work\", \"small hours\", etc.\n- **Accuracy:** \"some companies very strict\" is missing a verb (\"are very strict\").\n- **Range:** Very limited, with little originality in expression.\n- **Conclusion:** Same issues. **Band 5\u20136** in Lexical Resource.\n\n**Answer 3:**\n> \"Do you think people have more free time in your country now compared to the past?\"  \n> \"Yes, I think so. Yeah, I think they have more free time, not like in the past, like my grandfather. He can't have any free time in the past, like now. Now we have more free time because technologies makes everything faster and in the past it takes more time to finish things. So we have more free time right now. My grandfather, he's a farmer and he gets up sun up, work all days, no machines like now. Now farms very very big and have very big machine do all the work and no like using hands like grandfather.\"\n\n- **Vocabulary used:** A bit more varied, with some attempt to compare past and present (e.g., \"machines\", \"sun up\", \"free time\").\n- **Accuracy:** \"technologies makes\" should be \"technologies make\"; \"farms very very big\" is awkward; \"no like using hands\" is non-standard.\n- **Range:** Slightly better range, but still basic and somewhat repetitive.\n- **Conclusion:** Slightly better, but still limited. **Band 6.5** in Lexical Resource.\n\n**Answer 4:**\n> \"Do you think people will have more or less free time in the future?\"  \n> \"I'm actually, I think it do have more time. Technology everyday is developed and we don't need to do anything like before. And in the future some technology will do everything, we just do our hobby. Robots, robots can do all the work in house, in business. Robots can to clean all house and fridge tell shop food we need and shop send food so nobody go to shop. Robots build, robots can build everything like car, plane, no human. And computer can do much work in office.\"\n\n- **Vocabulary used:** Some more advanced terms (\"robots\", \"technology\", \"future\", \"developed\"), but with many grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.\n- **Accuracy:** Many errors: \"it do have\", \"can to clean\", \"tell shop food we need\", \"no human\", \"much work in office\" (should be \"a lot of work\").\n- **Range:** Slightly more varied, but still limited due to grammatical errors and awkward phrasing.\n- **Conclusion:** Limited but with more varied vocabulary. **Band 6.5** in Lexical Resource.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Overall Evaluation of Lexical Resource (Band Score)**\n\n- **Vocabulary Range:** Limited, with frequent repetition and overuse of basic vocabulary.\n- **Accuracy:** Many grammatical errors and inappropriate word choices.\n- **Use of Idioms/Phrasal Verbs:** Very little to none.\n- **Conclusion:** Based on the overall lexical resource, the answers demonstrate a **limited range of vocabulary with frequent repetition and inaccuracies**, which is consistent with a **Band 6** in IELTS Speaking (or 6.5 with some minor exceptions).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Lexical Resource Band Score: Band 6 (approx.)**\n\n- **Reasoning:** Limited vocabulary with frequent repetition, grammatical errors, and minimal use of varied or sophisticated vocabulary. However, in a few answers, there was slightly more vocabulary variation (e.g., \"robots\", \"technology\", etc.), which could justify a Band 6.5, but due to overall simplicity and inaccuracies, a **Band 6** is more accurate."}

{"label": "Band score Lexical Resource: 7", "pred": "Based on the provided answers for **IELTS Speaking Part 3** (Topic: Different types of memories) and the **CTTR score of 6.459**, the evaluation for the **\"Lexical Resource\"** band score is as follows:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Lexical Resource Band Score: 6.5**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Strengths:**\n- **Use of Appropriate Vocabulary:** The candidate uses a reasonable range of vocabulary to express ideas, such as \"happy or unhappy memories\", \"important historical events\", \"social media\", and \"Renaissance\".\n- **Some Precise Lexical Choices:** There are instances of precise vocabulary, such as \u201cpermanently recorded\u201d, \u201cpart of our character\u201d, \u201ccultural significance\u201d, and \u201ccountry that culture comes before the name of the country\u201d.\n- **General Communication is Clear:** Although not always precise, the candidate generally communicates their ideas effectively using varied vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f **Weaknesses:**\n- **Repetition of Basic Vocabulary:** There is overuse of simple, high-frequency words like \"remember\", \"people\", \"things\", \"history\", and \"country\". This affects the overall lexical variety.\n- **Inconsistent Use of Academic/Advanced Vocabulary:** Some parts of the answers lack variety in vocabulary. For example:\n  - Repeated use of \u201cI think\u201d, \u201cI believe\u201d, \u201cI think it\u2019s important\u201d.\n  - Limited use of academic or precise terms, e.g., when discussing Renaissance, the candidate could have used terms like \"cultural rebirth\", \"humanism\", or \"Florentine patronage\".\n- **Grammatical Errors Affecting Lexical Use:** Though not strictly a lexical issue, grammatical errors (e.g., \"I came across different articles that said that memory delete or erase bad moments\") can limit the effectiveness of word choice.\n- **Unclear or Awkward Phrasing:** Some phrases are unclear or awkward, such as \u201cthe only thing we had at the time was Florence, which had a big knowledge of Latin, big knowledge of everything\u201d \u2013 the phrasing is repetitive and not very idiomatic.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Recommendations for Improvement:**\n- **Expand Lexical Range:** Practice using more advanced and varied vocabulary, especially in academic topics.\n- **Use Synonyms and Paraphrase:** Avoid repeating the same words.

Think about the context and the most suitable word.\n- **Avoid Over-Use of \"I Think\" and \"I Believe\":** Use alternatives like \u201cFrom my perspective\u201d, \u201cIn my view\u201d, \u201cIt could be argued that\u201d, etc.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Summary:**\nThe candidate\u2019s **Lexical Resource** is **adequate** but limited.

Let\u2019s break down how the given answer aligns with the IELTS rubric for Lexical Resource (Band Score 0-9). \n\n---\n\n### **1. Range of Vocabulary (Vocabulary Diversity)**\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The answer uses repetitive and simplistic vocabulary (e.g., \u201clie,\u201d \u201ctruth,\u201d \u201ctell lie,\u201d \u201cnot true\u201d).\n- Limited use of idiomatic or collocational expressions (e.g., \"broke their heart,\" \"make a friendship with someone\").\n- There\u2019s minimal use of phrasal verbs or complex vocabulary.\n- The speaker often uses fillers and hesitations (e.g., \u201cI think,\u201d \u201cfor example,\u201d \u201cit depends\u201d) and sometimes misuses prepositions or conjunctions (e.g., \u201cI have I\u2019m a person\u201d).\n- The vocabulary is basic and doesn't show a wide range of words appropriate for academic or conversational speaking in an IELTS context.\n\n**Score:** **Band 5.5 - 6.0**  \n*Reason:* The vocabulary is basic and lacks variety, but it's functional and understandable.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Accuracy of Vocabulary (Use of Correct Words in Context)**\n\n**Analysis:**\n- There are several errors in vocabulary usage:\n  - **\"the worst situation\"** \u2192 should be **\u201cthe worst situation\u201d** or **\u201ca dangerous situation.\u201d**\n  - **\u201cI think the lie is accepted when, for example, you are in a worst situation\u201d** \u2013 \u201cworst\u201d is used incorrectly. It should be **\u201cthe worst\u201d** (comparative form).\n  - **\u201cI think I don't like, I don't like somebody are reliable to everyone.\u201d** \u2013 Grammatically and semantically unclear.\n  - **\u201cthey think about us the bad person.\u201d** \u2013 Incorrect word order and unclear phrasing.\n  - **\u201cI prefer to make a friendship with everyone can be a truth, for example, truth person.\u201d** \u2013 Very awkward sentence construction.\n  - **\u201che told me not actually, I'm not, I'm not at home from morning to night.\u201d** \u2013 The grammar and structure is very informal and awkward, but the meaning is still somewhat clear.\n\n**Score:** **Band 5.0 - 5.5**  \n*Reason:* Vocabulary is often misused or incorrectly phrased, which affects clarity and fluency.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Overall Lexical Resource Evaluation (Band Score)**\n\nCombining both **range** and **accuracy**, the vocabulary used in this answer is:\n\n- **Limited in range** \u2013 mostly basic words with little variation or academic vocabulary.\n- **Low in accuracy** \u2013 frequent grammatical and lexical errors that hinder clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Lexical Resource Band Score: 5.0 - 5.5**\n\nThis is consistent with the **CTTR (Corrected Test-Taker Rating)** of **5.235**, which would round to **Band 5.5** for **Lexical Resource**.\n\n---\n\n### **Areas for Improvement (to Aim for Band 6.5+):**\n- Use a **variety of vocabulary** (e.g., \u201cdeception,\u201d \u201cmisrepresentation,\u201d \u201chonesty,\u201d \u201cintegrity\u201d).\n- Avoid **repetition** of words like \u201clie,\u201d \u201ctruth,\u201d and \u201ctell.\u201d\n- Improve **grammar and syntax** to support more precise word usage.\n- Use **idiomatic expressions** (e.g., \u201cwhite lie,\u201d \u201csave face,\u201d \u201cprotect someone\u2019s feelings\u201d).\n- Practice **complex sentence structures** for clarity and fluency.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help rewriting the answers to improve the Lexical Resource!"}

While fillers are common in spoken English, excessive use can reduce the impression of **lexical resource**.\n   - The phrase **\"um\"** appears frequently (e.g., **\"um, I teach and also, um, I learn music\"**), which affects fluency and lexical variety.\n\n2. **Limited Range of Lexical Items**:\n   - While there are some **descriptive verbs** and **nouns**, the **vocabulary is somewhat basic** and repetitive. For example:\n     - **\"schedule\"** is used multiple times in different forms: **\"schedule,\" \"schedules,\" \"scheduled.\"**\n     - The speaker uses **\"lesson\"** repeatedly without variation.\n     - Words like **\"important\"** and **\"time\"** are used frequently without synonyms or paraphrasing.\n\n3. **Errors in Word Choice**:\n   - There is **no major vocabulary error** in terms of **incorrect words or misuse**.\n   - However, the lack of **variety and complexity** reduces the **lexical score**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Score:\n- **Score: 5.5 (as per CTTR: 5.512)** \u2013 This aligns well with the evaluation.

Task Focus and Appropriate Lexical Resource (Band 6.5 - 7.0)**\n\nThe answer shows a **reasonable range of vocabulary** that is **generally appropriate** to the topic. The speaker uses terms related to **craft-making, family traditions, childhood experiences, and emotional tone**, such as:\n\n- \"3D Christmas cards\"\n- \"little sticky bits\"\n- \"nitty-gritty\"\n- \"family tradition\"\n- \"spending quality time\"\n- \"digital way\"\n- \"arts and crafts\"\n- \"Christmas music in the back\"\n- \"pass it down\"\n\nThere is evidence of **basic vocabulary** being used **effectively**, with **some more specific and idiomatic expressions**, like \"nitty-gritty\" and \"pass it down.\"\n\nHowever, the vocabulary is **not always precise or varied**.

Lexical Errors and Accuracy (Band 6.0 - 6.5)**\n\nThere are **some minor errors** in word choice or usage, although they do **not significantly hinder understanding**. For instance:\n\n- \"we had different layers that we had to put together with little, little sticky bits\" \u2014 the phrase \"sticky bits\" is colloquial and slightly informal; a more precise term like **\"glue dots\" or \"adhesive tabs\"** might be better.\n- \"If they didn't send us a card the year before, we usually didn't send them one back\" \u2014 slightly awkward phrasing. A more natural way might be **\"we only sent them one if they sent us one the year before\"**.\n- \"Christmas music in the back\" \u2014 possibly refers to **\"playing in the background\"**, but the phrasing is non-standard and could be more clearly expressed.\n- \"Not often, I'm not much of an arts and crafts kind of person\" \u2014 the phrasing is a bit jumbled and could be smoother.\n\nThese errors are **not severe**, but they show **some lack of confidence or control** over vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n### **3.

Based on the given answer, here's an **evaluation of the Lexical Resource** component in the context of IELTS Speaking Part 2:\n\n---\n\n### **Strengths:**\n\n1. **Vocabulary Range (Topic-Related and General):**  \n   The speaker uses a wide range of vocabulary that is relevant to the topic (gifts, travel, art, shopping, personal feelings, etc.). Phrases such as *\u201ccaptivated by the beautiful buildings\u201d*, *\u201cexquisite blue tiles\u201d*, *\u201cbreathtaking\u201d*, and *\u201csang to me\u201d* show good lexical control and variety.\n\n2. **Descriptive Language:**  \n   The candidate uses rich, descriptive language to convey the experience, such as *\u201cstartling\u201d*, *\u201cbreathtaking\u201d*, *\u201cheavily wrapped gift\u201d*, *\u201cdifferent shades of green\u201d*, which indicates an ability to use precise, context-appropriate vocabulary.\n\n3. **Cohesive Use of Words (Linkers and Connectors):**  \n   The speaker uses some linking devices such as *\u201cas I said earlier\u201d*, *\u201cobviously\u201d*, *\u201cthe next night\u201d*, and *\u201cjust as we were finishing the dessert\u201d*, which helps maintain coherence and smooth the flow of ideas.\n\n4. **Idiomatic Use (e.g. \u201csang to me\u201d):**  \n   There's evidence of idiomatic or figurative language like *\u201cit sang to me\u201d*, which adds color and creativity to the vocabulary, showing a good grasp of lexical expressions beyond the literal.\n\n---\n\n### **Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Some Repetition (Moderate):**  \n   While the vocabulary is rich, there are instances of repetition, particularly in the use of *\u201creally\u201d* (\u201cI really, really wanted it\u201d) and *\u201cwas\u201d* (\u201cwas my favorite building\u201d, \u201cwas very heavy\u201d). This could be seen as a minor flaw in lexical variety, though not overly impactful.\n\n2. **Overuse of Simple Nouns and Adjectives:**  \n   Some parts of the answer rely on basic vocabulary, such as *\u201cshops\u201d*, *\u201ctile\u201d*, *\u201cfish\u201d*, and *\u201cgreen\u201d*, which, while appropriate, could have been enhanced with more sophisticated or specific vocabulary (e.g., *\u201cceramic tile\u201d*, *\u201cIznik tiles\u201d* could have been elaborated more).\n\n3. **Limited Use of Formal or Academic Vocabulary:**  \n   The answer is mostly conversational in tone and doesn\u2019t show a clear attempt to use more formal or academic vocabulary, which could be expected in a higher-band answer for *Lexical Resource*. However, this is acceptable for Part 2, which is more personal and narrative in nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Band Score Prediction (Lexical Resource):**\n\nGiven the **wide range of vocabulary**, **use of descriptive and figurative language**, **some repetition**, and **limited use of formal vocabulary**, the **Lexical Resource score** is likely in the **6.5\u20137.0** range.\n\nIn the provided **CTTR (Computerized Test Response) score of 6.935**, this aligns well with a **Lexical Resource score of 6.5\u20137.0**, which is consistent with the strengths and minor weaknesses identified above.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Lexical Resource Band Score: 6.5 \u2013 7.0**\n\nThe candidate demonstrates a **good range of vocabulary** with **some repetition** but overall **clear and accurate lexical choices** that effectively convey the message.

Here's a detailed evaluation based on the IELTS criteria for \"Lexical Resource\":\n\n---\n\n### **Strengths of the Answer (Lexical Resource):**\n\n1. **Use of Specific Vocabulary:**\n   - The speaker uses some specific vocabulary related to the topic, e.g., *\"medicine school,\" \"programming,\" \"hospital,\" \"stressful moment,\" \"tough decision,\" \"feel confident.\"*\n   - Terms like *\"decision-making,\" \"change of career,\" \"technology,\" \"failed a test\"* are relevant and specific to the topic of a significant memory.\n\n2. **Basic Vocabulary for Description:**\n   - The answer includes vocabulary related to describing experiences, emotions, and decisions, such as *\"stressful,\" \"not an easy decision,\" \"not a pleasant experience,\" \"happy,\" \"worth the price.\"*\n\n3. **Attempt to Express Complex Ideas:**\n   - The speaker attempts to express complex emotions and experiences using phrases like *\"it was not something for me,\" \"took me a while to feel confident,\" \"worth the price to take the risk.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Weaknesses of the Answer (Lexical Resource):**\n\n1. **Limited Range of Vocabulary:**\n   - The vocabulary is fairly basic and repetitive. Many words and phrases are used in a limited way, e.g., \"not easy,\" \"not a pleasant experience,\" \"stressful moment,\" and \"tough decision\" are repeated with little variation.\n   - The answer lacks more advanced or academic vocabulary that would be expected in a higher band score.\n\n2. **Lack of Sophistication and Precision:**\n   - There is a lack of more advanced or nuanced vocabulary to fully express the emotional weight of the decision, such as *\"a pivotal life decision,\" \"a paradigm shift,\" \"a defining moment,\" \"a career transition.\"*\n   - Some parts of the answer could be more clearly articulated using better lexical choices. For example, *\"I was doing quite good\"* is vague and not well-expressed.\n\n3. **Errors in Lexical Usage:**\n   - The answer has lexical errors, such as:\n     - *\"I have no doubts about that the biggest decision...\"* \u2013 incorrect structure.\n     - *\"I decide to change to programming was a really stressful moment...\"* \u2013 awkward structure and missing punctuation.\n     - *\"was not really an easy topic at all for me...\"* \u2013 incorrect use of \"topic\" instead of \"decision.\"\n\n4. **Use of Fillers and Repetition:**\n   - The answer includes many fillers and repetitions that reduce the lexical variety and precision:\n     - *\"was not not an easy decision\"*\n     - *\"was not really an easy topic at all for me for my family for my friends\"*\n     - *\"I feel now I feel really happy\"*\n\n---\n\n### **Band Score Estimation (Lexical Resource):**\n\nBased on the IELTS criteria for **Lexical Resource** (Band 4.0 - 9.0):\n\n- **Band 6.0:**\n  - Uses a sufficient range of vocabulary to talk about most areas of interest.\n  - Attempts to use less common vocabulary, but with limited success.\n  - Makes some errors in word choice and/or spelling.\n\n- **Band 5.5:**\n  - Uses a limited range of vocabulary.\n  - Often uses simple vocabulary with limited variety.\n  - Makes frequent errors in word choice and/or spelling.\n\n- **Band 5.0:**\n  - Uses a very limited range of vocabulary.\n  - Makes frequent errors in word choice and spelling.\n\n### \u2705 **Estimated Band Score for \"Lexical Resource\": 5.5**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Recommendations for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Expand Your Vocabulary:**\n   - Use more advanced synonyms: instead of *\u201cstressful,\u201d* try *\u201ctrying,\u201d \u201cdaunting,\u201d \u201cchallenging,\u201d* or *\u201coverwhelming.\u201d*\n   - Use more precise vocabulary to describe decisions: *\u201cpivotal,\u201d \u201ctransformative,\u201d \u201cdefining,\u201d* or *\u201clife-altering.\u201d*\n\n2. **Use a Variety of Expressions:**\n   - Avoid repeating phrases such as *\u201cnot an easy decision\u201d* \u2013 vary your expressions: *\u201ca difficult choice,\u201d \u201ca tough call,\u201d \u201ca complicated decision.\u201d*\n\n3. **Improve Sentence Structure:**\n   - Avoid awkward or run-on sentences and reduce filler words such as *\"um,\" \"like,\" \"you know,\"* etc.\n   - Practice speaking in complete, clear, and grammatically correct sentences.\n\n4. **Practice Descriptive Language:**\n   - Use more descriptive and emotional language to convey the significance of the memory, such as: *\u201ca moment of great self-realization,\u201d \u201ca turning point in my life,\u201d \u201can experience that shaped my identity.\u201d*\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a **sample answer with improved lexical resource**!"}
{"label": "Band score Lexical Resource: 6", "pred": "The evaluation of **Lexical Resource** in the IELTS Speaking Part 2 answer is based on the **range** and **accuracy** of vocabulary used. Let's analyze the given answer in terms of the **Lexical Resource** rubric for IELTS Speaking:\n\n---\n\n### **Given Answer:**\n\n> \"So the person is my father. The reason why is he's also a designer and he also taught me like how to draw and things since I was pretty much baby. And when he was young he wanted to come to the US to study but he couldn't do it. Then he put me in that situation so now I'm in the US. Yes. And also every time like I need to make a big decision he always support it to me and he knows what I am and he always knows like what should I do.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Lexical Resource:**\n\n1. **Range of Vocabulary:**\n   - The vocabulary used is **limited** and **not very varied**. There is overuse of simple expressions such as:\n     - \"he also taught me like how to draw and things\"\n     - \"he put me in that situation\"\n     - \"he always knows like what should I do\"\n   - There is **repetition** of structures like \"he always knows like what...\" and \"he always support it to me.\"\n   - The speaker also uses **colloquial and informal expressions** such as \"like\", \"things\", and \"pretty much baby\".\n   - The vocabulary is mostly **basic and lacks sophistication**. Phrases like \"he put me in that situation\" could be expressed more clearly or with more appropriate vocabulary.\n   - There is **no use of specialized or academic vocabulary**, which is acceptable in speaking, but shows limited lexical variety.\n\n2. **Accuracy of Vocabulary:**\n   - There are **some grammatical and lexical inaccuracies**:\n     - \"he always support it to me\" \u2192 incorrect verb form; should be \"he always supports me\" or \"he always supports my decisions\".\n     - \"he always knows like what should I do\" \u2192 informal, unclear structure; should be \"he always knows what I should do\" or \"he always knows what I need to do.\"\n     - \"he put me in that situation\" \u2192 vague and could be clearer with a more specific expression.\n\n3. **Overall Impression:**\n   - The speaker uses **simple vocabulary** with **limited variation**.\n   - The **lexical resource is not sufficient** to show a good range of vocabulary.\n   - The **language is not idiomatic** in many cases, and the speaker seems to be struggling to express ideas clearly, which could lead to **repetition** and **awkward phrasing**.\n\n---\n\n### **Band Score Estimation for Lexical Resource:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, the **Lexical Resource** would likely score between **5.0 to 5.5** if considering only this criterion, depending on the other criteria (fluency, coherence, grammar). However, since the **CTTR (Cohesion, Task Response, and Grammatical Range and Accuracy)** is **4.308**, this suggests that **Lexical Resource** would likely be **around 4.0 to 4.5**, as it's a component of the overall score.\n\n---\n\n### **Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1. Use more **diverse vocabulary**:\n   - Instead of \"teach me how to draw and things\", say \"taught me how to draw and other artistic skills.\"\n   - Instead of \"he put me in that situation\", say \"he ensured that I had the opportunity to study in the US\" or \"he made it possible for me to study here.\"\n\n2. Avoid informal expressions like \"like\", \"things\", \"pretty much baby\" in formal speaking contexts.\n\n3. Practice expressing complex ideas with more precise and varied vocabulary.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Evaluation for **Lexical Resource**:  \n**Band: 4.0\u20134.5 (depending on other criteria)**\n\nThe answer shows **limited lexical resource**, with **repetition, inaccuracies, and a lack of sophistication** in vocabulary. It meets the **lower end of Band 4** but does not reach Band 5 consistently due to the issues outlined."}

The **language is functional but not sophisticated or varied enough** to achieve a score higher than 5.5 in the Lexical Resource criterion. Therefore, the score of **5.5** is a fair evaluation for **Lexical Resource**.\n\nIf you'd like an overall band score or evaluation for **Fluency and Coherence**, **Grammatical Range and Accuracy**, or **Pronunciation**, I'd be happy to help with that as well."}
