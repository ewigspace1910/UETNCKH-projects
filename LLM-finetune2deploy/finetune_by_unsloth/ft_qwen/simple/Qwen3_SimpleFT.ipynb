For example, the transition between describing the park before and after is not smooth.\\n\\nLexical Resource: Your lexical resource is limited. You rely on simple vocabulary and basic sentence structures, which restrict your ability to express ideas effectively. There is frequent repetition of words and phrases, such as ``park`` and ``things,`` which indicates a narrow range of vocabulary. You need to expand your vocabulary to discuss topics related to healthcare, such as ``government,`` ``healthcare services,`` ``affordable,`` ``insurance,`` etc.\\n\\nGrammatical Range & Accuracy: Your grammatical range is limited, and errors in grammar and punctuation are frequent. These errors impede meaning and affect the clarity of your response. For example, there are errors in verb tense and sentence structure. You need to focus on using a wider range of grammatical structures accurately to convey your ideas effectively.\"\\n        }'}\n",

It provides examples and suggests reward types, fulfilling the task\\'s main points. However, the discussion could be more thoroughly linked back to the core question, and some points feel somewhat general.\\n\\nCoherence & Cohesion: The essay demonstrates a clear logical progression. Paragraphs are well-defined, and transitions are generally smooth. Cohesive devices are used effectively to link ideas, contributing to the overall coherence of the response. More variety in cohesive devices could further enhance the flow.\\n\\nLexical Resource: The vocabulary is adequate and appropriate for the task. The meaning is generally clear, although the range of vocabulary could be broader and more precise. There are instances where more sophisticated word choices would elevate the response. Overall, the vocabulary is sufficient but not particularly noteworthy.\\n\\nGrammatical Range & Accuracy: The essay demonstrates a mix of simple and complex sentence structures. While grammatical errors are present, they rarely impede communication. The writing is generally accurate and easy to understand. A greater variety in sentence structures and more precise control of grammar would improve the overall quality.\"\\n        }'}\n",
