Um, I've enjoyed living there, but um, I think it's essential to move like every three or four years. So I've lived there for two years and a half, so probably I should, yeah, I should get going soon.\n\nTopic: School trips\nQuestions:\nWhat was your favorite school trip when you were a child?\nWhat makes it a good school trip?\nDid you take the same kinds of school trips as your parents?\nHave any types of school trips become more popular these days?\n\nAnswers:\nAh, with your school trip, well, um, can I, can I tell about the university trip? So it was a hike, um, we went to the mountains and we spent there four days. That was my first experience hiking and, uh, since then I've, I've really, um, yeah, I've done it a lot.\nIt was very well organized. I felt safe and I got all the equipment, all the instructions, and also there were great people with us and great leaders.\nI don't think so. I don't think my parents have ever been to the mountains because, um, that wasn't in Russia, that wasn't in this area, it was in America. So my school was, um, like located pretty much at the footstep of a mountain, and, uh, my parents did not study next to mountains, so no.\nIn Russia, yeah, I think these days schools have more opportunities to take the schoolchildren abroad and I definitely don't think that was like a common practice at the time when my parents were children.\n\nTopic: Fashion\nQuestions:\nDo you consider yourself to be a fashionable person?\nIs being trendy important in your country?\nAre the most popular people in life the most fashionable?\nIs it easy to be fashionable without spending a lot of money?\n\nAnswers:\nYes and no I think sometimes when you don't pay too much attention to fashion you just appear to be fashionable but when you kind of give it a lot of thought it's kind of seems a little bit too how to say too too enforced\nSome people may say so, um, in St. Petersburg where I live there are many trendy people and there are many, um, shopping malls and, I don't know, like designer boutiques where you can get, um, pretty like interesting clothes. Also people buy clothes abroad, um, but being trendy is not that important to me personally.\nOf course not. I don't think so. Why not? Well, look at, I don't know, look at some of the, um, look at some of the, uh, businessmen who, um, who we see, um, yeah, in the media. I think they dress really, really simple and make a point out of it.\nAbsolutely, thrift stores rule.", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 9.0"}

I was not very good at maths and my dad actually had to help me quite a bit to get a good mark.\nI think it's quite important that I can handle numbers but my job doesn't fully focus on numbers as a main priority it's it's important that I'm not number blind but I I can I think I'm alright.\n\nTopic: Cycling\nQuestions:\nWhen did you learn to ride a bike?\nIs riding a bike popular in your country, and why?\nHow easy is it to cycle around the town or the city you are living right now?\nWould you like to go on a cycling holiday in the future?\n\nAnswers:\nSince I'm Dutch that was very early I think I was around maybe five years old um yeah by my dad I think my dad taught me and definitely fell over a few times\nI think we're known for riding bikes a lot. Well, we've got really good infrastructure, so we've got lots of cycling paths and that really helps because cycling is made really easy and safe, so everyone cycles to work, to school.\nWell, I don't cycle a lot where I live at the moment because the first time I rode a bike I kind of got hit by a car so now I'm a little bit scared to get back on my bike.\nNo, I'm not.

I am always running late, so I don't have time for proper breakfast, I just grab a coffee. I have classes all day and get home at about 5 pm, and after dinner I usually try to do some study.\nThe afternoon, definitely.

It is a very big city, about 7 million people live there.\nOh yes, a very interesting place to live. Hyderabad has a very long history, so there are lots of ancient forts, mosques, and other monuments. There is a very beautiful lake, and there are also lots of wonderful markets.\nYes, I think once I finish my studies here, I'll go back to Hyderabad. My husband is from Hyderabad too, so I think we'll stay there.\n\nTopic: Hobbies and interests\nQuestions:\nWhat hobbies and interests are popular in your country?\nWhich hobbies and interests do you enjoy?\nWhat hobbies and interests did you have as a child?\nDo you think parents should encourage their children to have a hobby or interest?\n\nAnswers:\nPeople have many different pastimes in my country. I think the most popular these days are things like gardening and do-it-yourself, which is when people, well, usually men, make things for their home. I think women tend not to have too many hobbies. You can't really call shopping a hobby. I think in the past, women used to fill up the leisure time that they had with craft activities, but sewing and knitting aren't so common these days. I think reading is still very popular, especially now these days with the new e-readers.\nUm, well, like a lot of people, my work takes up a lot of my time and at the weekend I like to meet up with my friends or go out with my husband so I don't really have much time for hobbies. But I do read a lot, especially history and biography. Also, I love collecting art so I go to a lot of art fairs. I really like colorful abstract art which really brighten up our homes.\nGosh, uh, that was a long time ago. Let me think. Uh, I used to collect keyrings. I think I had about twenty or twenty-five. They were silly things really, but fun for a small child. Uh, I used to like painting and drawing. My parents were very supportive and they bought me a lot of oil paints, but I'm not really very talented. I also played the clarinet. I was in a junior orchestra. I remember once we, uh, we played a concert and my reed broke during the first piece, and so I couldn't make any sound.\nOh yes, very much so. I think it is very important for children to have something other than school, television, and computers. Sometimes a hobby can turn into a very successful career, but even if it doesn't, it can help the child develop as a person as they learn about new things and meet new people who share the same hobby.\n\nTopic: Weather\nQuestions:\nDo you prefer hot weather or cold?\nWhich time of year did you enjoy the most as a child?\nHas the weather changed much in your country in recent years?\n\nAnswers:\nAh, I think I prefer cold weather. I know most people prefer hot weather, but it is always so hot in my country that it is such a nice change to feel the cold. Of course, in the cold, it's very easy to put on a hat and gloves to keep ourselves warm. Tell me about the weather in your country at different times of year. India is so big that there are many different climates, so I'll just talk about the weather in Hyderabad. Generally, we have a tropical wet and dry climate. That means that the summers, March to June, are hot, over 30 degrees and very humid. Sometimes it can reach over 40, which is just unbearable. At the end of the summer, the monsoon comes, and it rains for about three months. After the rainy season, it's winter, which is quite short, just a couple of months.\nWell, I think like most children, I would say the summer, when we had the long school holiday. But I always preferred spring. There's something so lovely about when everything starts to grow again after the winter. You can almost smell it in the air.\nI don't think so really. I know that in some countries the climate has been changing because of global warming, but where I live it seems to be the same. Just heat and rain. I have noticed something, in recent summers when it's very hot, there have been many water shortages. I don't remember that happening when I was younger.", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 9.0"}

And I have to say that they were really fascinating because you know different things and you start learning different ways of thinking and that's, I think that that's the main point.\nI would love to visit Japan because I really appreciate their culture, they speak me really well about all their inhabitants, and I'm really looking forward to it to be honest, because I think that they have a completely different way of thinking and that is truly interesting.\nI do prefer the countryside to be honest but nowadays it's really difficult to live in there I mean you need to live in the city because if you live in the countryside you need to travel every single day at least one hour but I think that living in the countryside you get that peaceful feeling you can just see all the birds and all the different things that you don't you don't appreciate that in the city even though you have green spaces I mean just a clear example is London you have huge parks but it's not the same feeling that going to the countryside where you can really feel you can really breathe fresh air\n\nTopic: Food\nQuestions:\nWhat kind of food do you prefer?\nWhat kinds of food are popular in your country?\nWhat is the most important thing for you when you go to a restaurant?\n\nAnswers:\nI have to say that I love Mediterranean food.

For instance, they don't need to know, like, many facts because they know that they can simply Google them. Um, and also, um, there are so many apps being developed for, uh, yeah, for pretty much, uh, keeping things in mind, like, uh, your, your diaries, your schedules, and this is something that they may need.\nNo, I don't think it's always a good thing. It helps, but I think that we're also missing something with using our memory less. Maybe, yeah, I don't know, maybe it's, it is deteriorating due to this.\nWell, um, just again, again, certain apps on your phone, I'm sure, um, I don't know, like apps, like you can, you can set reminders that can like pop up at a certain time and, um, yeah, I'm sure that the technology is pretty much going that way and helping people fight their forgetfulness.\n\nTopic: Forgetfulness\nQuestions:\nSome people say, the older you are, the easier it is to forget something. What do you think?\nThinking about younger children now, why might they not be as forgetful?\nSpeaking of teenagers, do you think it is more likely that teenagers in a city, would be more forgetful than teenagers in the countryside?\n\nAnswers:\nUm, mm-hmm, yeah, this is a, this is a good question because I think in a certain way maybe, um, it is, it is getting harder and harder to keep, uh, like many like little details like for instance like meetings or times or names in mind but at the same time I think as you grow older, um, you tend to, uh, like recall certain like times in the past more often, more like in a way of like nostalgizing for, for, you know, for like some good, good periods in your life that you miss.\nUm, I don't think they are not as forgetful, I think they can be just as forgetful. Um, well, for instance, like, um, like teenagers, while they're still like learning to be responsible, um, they may just like not, not quite, um, acquire the habit of like keeping, I don't know, like the time in mind, so they can easily like lose the track of time while they're like playing football or playing games, and or, um, they may not develop like a habit of being punctual, so it's also, I think it's connected to forgetfulness.\nI've never thought about that, but teenagers in the city might be, might have more distractions than teenagers in the village, although I think it's like some very, like it's very stereotypical for me to say.", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 9.0"}

It brings a sense of personality in it. I think that getting a handmade scarf that's two meters long is way more fun than getting, you know, a mass-produced scarf that anyone could have bought at the local Primark.\n\nTopic: Manufactured Goods\nQuestions:\nWhat are the benefits of factory made manufactured goods compared to handmade goods?\nDo you think that its a good thing that robots are being used more and more now to produce manufactured goods?\nDo you think that perhaps even if they lose their jobs, there might be other kinds of job that could be created?\nCould you see a future where perhaps all manufactured goods would be made by factory robots?\n\nAnswers:\nThey are definitely more easily available, you can walk out onto the street and usually on a high street and you can buy any kind of item of clothing or a bowl or something along those lines. You can always get it and sometimes it's easier to buy something than to have to make it yourself because you don't have the means to do it. So that's a, I think that's why things like those are really popular and it's also, yeah, it's easy and sometimes cheaper as well.\nIt can be I definitely think that there's no avoiding it as robots become more involved they'll definitely become more involved in the in the making process but I also think that people are going to lose their jobs over it so there's a it's a bit of a mixed feeling one it's a good thing to keep evolving and to keep making new things including those robots but it will get make a lot of people lose their jobs which also isn't great.\nThere could be, there's definitely for people with higher university qualifications, it'll be still be easy to get a job because they can, you know, work with the robots and program them, but people who perhaps work on the ground, who do the nitty-gritty small work, who haven't had a big education, might not benefit from it so much.\nIn a very dystopian future, I think I could, um, from, from my experience, I think most people will want something that's, well, they'll want what's easiest and what's cheapest, but if they think about it maybe a bit more, they would want something that's made by human hands. Uh, so I feel like it might go up, there'll be lots of robots making things the one moment, and then maybe they'll go back to things being made by hand.", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 8.0"}

Fast food is so common nowadays and people are so busy so it's an easy option for families. I think there will be more health problems in our society in the future caused by poor diets.\n\nTopic: Eating habits\nQuestions:\nDoes food play an important role in your culture?\nWould you say people in your country have a healthy diet these days, or did people eat more healthily in the past?\nDo you think its important for a family to sit together to eat a meal in the evening?\n\nAnswers:\nYes, I think it does, when we have family get-togethers, there's always a lot of food, and we have a big meal when we celebrate religious holidays. I guess that's the same in most countries, food usually is connected to big cultural or religious festivals.\n\nThat's a difficult question. I think both diets could be healthy. You see, traditionally in Germany, people ate quite plain food like potatoes, meat, and bread, but they ate vegetables too, so in my view, I think the diet was quite healthy. And now our society is so multicultural, especially in the cities, that we have many other cuisines to choose from, such as Indian or Turkish, so we can have a varied healthy diet. So yes, I think both the traditional and the modern German diet could be healthy, just the people need to make the right choice.\n\nYes, ideally, if it's possible.

{"input": "Evaluate the following answer(s) for IELTS speaking test for the rubric \"Grammatical Range and Accuracy\".\n\nItems to be evaluated:\nIELTS speaking test part: Part 3\nTopic: Attitudes to gift\nQuestions:\nCan you tell me something about how people feel when they receive a homemade gift and when they receive a shop-bought gift?\nDo you think children gain more pleasure receiving gifts than adults do?\nDo you think that more people get more pleasure giving or receiving gifts?\n\nAnswers:\nWell, I think as with everything, it depends on the person and the gift. When a grandchild makes something for their grandparents, like a bookmark or a clay pot that they've made at school, then obviously their grandparents will treasure it. For adults, I think it's a bit different. If people are going to give homemade gifts, then they need to be of really good quality. Why do you say that? Well, when children make things, it's the thought that counts. But when it's adults making things, it has to look like the present is a proper present, rather than something they've made just because it's cheaper. Of course, the thought still counts, and in many ways, our time now is more important or precious than money. So if somebody has spent a lot of time making a gift, it will mean a lot. But if someone has made some chutneys or pickles or some other type of food, then it has to be edible and taste nice as well. Most gifts these days are shop-bought, and there isn't really anything wrong with that. What is important, I think, with a shop-bought gift is that the person buying the gift should spend some time thinking about what the other person would really appreciate. It's no good a husband going into a perfume shop and buying the first perfume he likes. He needs to see what perfume his wife is wearing. That shows his wife that he's paying her attention.\nYes and no. Obviously children love receiving gifts but children do generally get a lot of gifts. Children these days are spoiled and they get too many gifts. So the more gifts they get the less they value them. Adults on the other hand generally have the resources to buy things for themselves. So if they really want something they can buy it. Of course this then makes present buying for adults much more difficult but of course there are things that we'd like that we can't really afford or we can afford them but can't justify their expense. For women it might be perfume or a day at the spa or a new pair of party heels. For men usually something to do with their hobbies or books or CDs.\nOh, um, this is a tricky one. Well, I think most people get pleasure out of both. Of course it depends. We may not get a lot of pleasure out of giving gifts to children who we know may not appreciate them. But, uh, if we have found the perfect gift for someone we love and we know it's going to make them happy, well, then this will really fill our hearts with joy. Um, similarly, if someone receives a gift of something that they don't really want or they can sense that it has been bought out of haste, then this isn't really going to make them feel that good. But if it's something wonderful, then, well, of course, they're going to feel fantastic about it.\n\nTopic: Commercial aspect of gifting\nQuestions:\nHow much do advertisement influence people when they buy gifts?\nDo you think that some festivals have become commercialized as the result on the emphasis of buying gifts?\n\nAnswers:\nIn my opinion, probably not too much. I mean, most adverts are for things like cars and household products which aren't really gifts. Although, a lot of young people like to be given new phones and other gadgets, so if a parent isn't sure which model to get, then they could be influenced by advertising.\nOh yes, definitely. Yes, um, in fact, I think it's much worse than that. It's not just the old festivals becoming commercialized, but so-called new ones being created just for the sake of present-giving. Things like Valentine's Day and Mother's Day, these aren't Indian traditions, but suddenly we find we have to buy a present for our spouse on Valentine's Day. And while it is nice to recognize how important our mothers are, surely it should be something we do every day, not just once a year when we buy her some chocolates.", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 9.0"}

It is not just helping individual for gathering different vocabularies, but also it really helps for people to be patient at the same time to earn knowledge, gather knowledge about different aspects. And at the same moment, I think that if people do have enough time in their hands, like some spare time, not just doing some other activities, if they can cover different kind of books covering variety of aspects, they can improve their knowledge. At the same time, they can pass their time in a great manner.\nIn my opinion, a recent generation, I think individuals at the moment, they don't prefer physical books quite a lot because I believe like we've got a lot of advancements when it comes to considering technology. So people mostly prefer to read books online as we do have like variation, we do have a lot of options like Google's, we can, we can get books from there or even we can, we can earn any kind of knowledge that we want. So we can get anything literally for free. So wouldn't need to pay money to purchase a book, but also we can, we can stay at home, we can just use our computer or using internet and we can get anything that we want for free enough. So young generations, I think they mostly prefer reading books online rather than going for physical items.\nI would say the physical books is always great because when it comes to reading books online sometimes I think we can encounter we may encounter some distractions for example for me when it comes when it comes to having any kind of PDF online so what happens when it comes to reading few lines afterwards I got some notification from probably from Instagram or from YouTube then then straight on like I just push the button and I just start watching the videos or get some distractions so mostly to stay in touch I really prefer reading physical books rather than going for online books.\nOkay, so when it comes to the advantages I think the first thing about about money as we can get the ebooks online for free there's a lot of websites or places from where we can gather books for free I think that's the best advantages because we didn't need to pay money but considering the physical books I believe right we need to go to the market we need to show some effort to get the book in our hand and then we can we have to start covering up so the best advantages about when it comes to the money I think ebooks is the best option in my opinion.\nI would say that for personal development, not just university, but everybody should start reading books and I think like from parents, I think I think parents they have the responsibility to encourage young ones right so that they can they can start having that habits and they can day by day they can they can build up the habits and at the same time when they become adults they can earn you know enormous amounts of knowledge at the same time they can they can push themself in a place where they don't have to take you know motivation from others but they can go for reading books items by themselves. So I would say that universities you know especially professors teachers they also have the responsibility alongside parents.", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 8.0"}

I think that it's just a matter of really looking forward to learn something new. I think that everybody can be adventurous. You just need to, as I said, you just need to break that routine and you need to go out of your comfort zone and start realizing that there's a lot of things out there. Sometimes when you are just in a city and you know that bar that you like, you go all the time to that certain supermarket, and you go out and you see that there's different food, there's different type of things, there's different type of people, you start getting that feeling of being adventurous and you are all the time willing to have more and more all the time. Because I think that it's a good way to break with everything. It's a good way to either learn more about yourself and learn more about the world that you are living in. So I think that it's really good because first of all, you mature with all that. You go to another country that they don't speak, they may don't speak English, they may not speak your own language. So I think that it push yourself to a way where you need to have something, you need to eat, you need to express yourself. So it really helps you becoming a new person.\nI never thought about that question to be honest. I think that is really valuable because probably it's not helping yourself, it's helping the whole society. Having people out there that they're exploring and learning all the new creatures and all the different things that you can find out there, it helps us as a human being to keep growing and keep evolving.\nI do think so as well it's just it's really related to what I was saying we need to know our world but I think that it's good to have new goals and I think that exploring the universe it will help everything it will help our economy it will help understanding ourself and in general it will help everything all society economy and all that kind of different stuff.", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 8.0"}

They are quite popular. It depends on like, the person actually. Like, people, designer clothes are usually very expensive, so only people of certain social, I mean, socioeconomic class can buy those clothes. So they are popular in certain segments of the society, yes.\nI think because it has a social status attached to it so when you're buying like when you're wearing a specific label people recognize it and then it shows like what kind of class you belong to and and it is a huge thing in India I think so I think it's because of that it shows like you are from a different class of society and it shows your your affluence I think you can flaunt your affluence that way maybe that.\n\nTopic: Working clothes\nQuestions:\nDo you think you can judge someone based on the clothes they're wearing at work?\nShould people be forced to wear certain clothes in work?\nHow have work clothes changed in the last couple of decades?\n\nAnswers:\nI personally don't, but I think there is a certain image attached to what you're wearing and people build up perspectives about how someone is based on what they're wearing, I think. But personally, I don't.\nWell, they shouldn't be forced, but I think ever since like we were young, we are told to wear certain clothes in certain settings because it's appropriate. So in schools we wear uniforms and we are trained that way. When we go to a temple, we have a certain set of clothes, when we have festivals, we have a certain set of clothes. So I think when we are trained to dress in a certain way in a certain setting, you get used to it. So I don't think it's a, it's a, like people are forcing you to wear formal clothes in an office setting, but, uh, it's a tricky one. Um, well, I don't think someone should be forced, but as individuals, we should be aware enough of what not to wear in an official setting. So we should make that decision by ourselves. You don't feel like you're forced to do it.\nI think it has become less formal now in a lot of setting like I think companies like Google have made it really popular to where like engineers that are like smartest of people they just go to office wearing casual clothes just in a t-shirt and jeans which is very casual and they they lay more importance on on your work ethic like how how you work and how you how much you contribute rather than what you wear so that is really a refreshing change I think so it doesn't it shouldn't matter what you wear but like how you work and how much you contribute so I think times are changing and people are really getting more relaxed about what you wear", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 7.5"}

And secondly, the reason why people keep talking about memory is because it's part of our character as well, remember those things. Yes, just because it's also part of our character, remember certain moment.\nBasically, you know, I remember when I was younger, my mother used to keep all the photo, picture of myself, and she used to show to other people.

Italy was divided and the only thing we had at the time was Florence, which had a big knowledge of Latin, big knowledge of everything. And I think that is an event that will not happen again anymore.

I think that has a combination between chat and posting of images and comments so it's like a mix between Twitter any chat and Instagram what people like likes sharing what their activities and what they like or show off what are they doing.\nWhat I feel about that is that now you really don't have a sense of distance. You don't know, like, you can live, like, in any part of the world and kind of, you don't know, like, I went to, as an example, I went to Uruguay six months ago for the first time after one and a half year living here, and I don't feel that I have been away for so much. I'm, I have so much communication that you kind of lose the sense of being away because you are on your phone all the time checking what your friends are doing, sending you text messages or calling you, so you don't feel so far from them.\nThat's a really good question. I'm not exactly sure how this can help to have a real sense of the people that you're hiring since you are like a company trying to hire a person and you have, for example, I try to post only funny stuff. I don't like posting people, posting, sorry, I want to change that. I don't like posting pictures of people or myself. I just enjoy posting people of funny things that I see on the street. I don't know how this could help the company that is hiring me to make a decision about if I'm good or bad for a web developer position based on the pictures that I post. So I don't think so.\nWell, I feel that LinkedIn could be the best one because there you post a more serious profile of you and more things related to work and not related to your private life. So I think that could be a good option. It's always not 100% like accurate because there's no way to back to check the background of the information that you have there because it's what you post.

I feel that you are successful once you put passion in what you are doing.\nThat's a big question. I'm not exactly sure about what everyone else in Uruguay thinks because sometimes people think about success only thinking about money or how much money do you make or you don't. And I don't feel this way. You can make like billions and if you're not happy with what you're doing, you're not really successful, you're never happy.\nLet me think about that. I would say a lot of passion and sense, common sense, a lot of common sense and a sense of humanity.

Yes.\nPop music for the young people and then actually my father's age still also sing like country music.\nI think it's the people a lot of stress, have a lot of stress, that they need to release the stress, so that's a good.

Children can see some things that are not good for them in some sites that contain violence etc. Also people post videos of themselves or their friends in inappropriate poses. Another danger is cyber bullying and there have been many victims of this. Many children also become addicted to computer games.\nOf course, children are too young and don't think of the dangers. They believe everything they hear or see. For example, if they're talking with somebody they don't know and who pretends to be a good guy and asks them to meet with him somewhere, they will possibly go. If that person is not who he says he is, they may get into big trouble.\nYes, parents can do many different things to make sure their children are okay. They should put the computer somewhere and not in the child's bedroom. Then they can watch what their child is doing. Also, parents should talk to their children and tell to them the dangers of internet so that way the kids must know what to do and what not to do and be more careful. Another thing is that parents must have good relationship with their children so they can tell them if anything strange or unusual happens.\nThey should be allowed but they must be aware the dangers. If parents give them some valuable advice such as to not share internet passwords with anyone, to not reply to rude messages, to not post inappropriate photos and things like that, then there won't be any problem. But parents must always know of what their children are doing.\nWell there is more to expect from it. I don't know what but I'm sure there's still much more to come since it started. There are so many improvements and it will continue to grow more online information entertainment and social networking.

That's why they, the people who speak, speak those language, that language, they can even don't know about the problems and words like that.\nBecause they weren't adapted to the conditions which were changed, I suppose, I don't know, maybe they just simply assimilated into other cultures and it was easier to assimilate than to support their own culture.\nI suppose, yes.

Um, we started when I was around seven years old, and we made them in 3D, so we had different layers that we had to put together with little, little sticky, sticky bits. Um, and I really enjoyed doing that because it was a tradition, and I did it with my mum. So we, uh, started in November, we started making Christmas cards for all the friends and acquaintances that sent us a card the year before. If they didn't send us a card the year before, we usually didn't send them one back. Um, and it was quite difficult in the beginning because it's very nitty-gritty, small work, but, uh, it got better as I got older, and I think we kept doing it until I was about thirteen years old. Um, and the best reason for doing it was really just to spend time with my mum, with Christmas music in the back. And, um, it was always fun seeing the new kinds of cards that they brought out that year, so it was, usually it was some kind of animal, some kind of birds or, or puppies or whatever. And it was a lot of fun, actually, just spending some quality time together and having Christmas music in the back and cake in the oven and just spending a few hours doing something that was just ours, really. Um, I think we started doing it because my grandmother started doing, did it as well, so my mum used to do it with her mother and then I did it with mine. Um, so it's kind of a family tradition that's been passed down. Not often, I'm not much of an arts and crafts kind of person.

My next point is who prepared the meal. Well, I don't really know, but I can tell you about the restaurant. I remember it was very small, and we sat outside in a lovely courtyard. There were plants and flowers all around and a nice cool breeze blowing. Anyway, I decided that the safest option for me to order was a salad. I wasn't really expecting very much, but when I took my first mouthful, I was in heaven. Like, everything just tasted so fresh and full of flavor.

We had gone to Istanbul for a few days. My husband had always wanted to go there. Anyway, we had a few days holiday from work and we decided to fulfill my husband's dream. As I said earlier, I'm really interested in art and so even though I had no real desire to go to Istanbul, I was totally captivated by all the beautiful buildings and the wonderful arts and crafts that were available there. The Blue Mosque was my favorite building. From the outside, it looks just like a typical Ottoman mosque, but inside it is quite startling. The large windows with the light reflecting on the exquisite blue tiles made it just breathtaking. I asked one of the guides about the tiles and she told me that they were from Iznik and that they are still made today. When we left the Blue Mosque, we walked down a pedestrian lane full of shops, including some tile shops. In one of the shops, the owner told us that the tiles were made in Iznik. Anyway, one of the tiles really caught my eye. Actually, it sang to me. It was of fish, four big fish and lots of little ones, all in different shades of green. I really, really wanted it. But when we asked the price, it was very high, something like 300 American dollars. Obviously, I knew we could negotiate, but it seemed such a high price that we just left. The next night, we went out for my birthday meal. Just as we were finishing the dessert, the waiter came over and handed me the most beautifully wrapped gift. I knew at once, because it was very heavy, that it was the fish tile.", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 9.0"}

So the book is basically quite fascinating to me because this book really helps me to improve my overall grammar skill. I would say that I'm not at the moment having a great knowledge about English grammars because we've got vasts of items, we've got number of items that always we need to cover. But at least the level currently I'm having it, it's just because I covered the book almost most of the chapters. When it comes to the recommendation, I still remember back in 2020, around the middle, the middle of the year, so one of my friends from my university who suggested that if you really want to improve your English, you should start from learning the grammars because it not just help you to feel confident, but also it really help you to improve your accuracy level. So he just suggested that you should go for this book and it really helps you with your overall grammar skill because that time I tend to make a lot of mistakes. Of course like most of the chapters, I didn't get chance to cover that time, but at least the knowledge I used to have that time, that wasn't enough. So my friend, my friend and I, I, we went to a super shop, so there's a particular area where people they can purchase different of items of books, it could be some storybooks, sometimes we can purchase books about different languages. So we went there and he helped me to find out that book. So when I, when I get chance to see for, especially for few chapters, the book looks quite eye-catchy in a sense that we've got few, few pictures in the middle of that book.", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 8.0"}

I would love, as I said, to see all the Japanese culture. I really love the way they think, the way they act, the way they are so organized. Probably it's because it's so different from my country. So I think that that is really something that makes me want to go to the country. I want to know the culture and visit everything. Probably I will choose one of my best friends that is called Borja. I've been with him since we were three years old, so we went together to school, we went together to university. So he's kind of another brother for myself. And I think that we all, we both want to see the same things and we want to experience the same kind of things. So I will take him with me. Probably we don't need that big equipment or skills or abilities because it's just like normal traveling, it's just knowing the culture, just mixing with local people. I think that that's the best thing that you can do to really know the culture and really know the country. So I will say that the only thing that you need is a bag, so we'll be backpacking. That is really interesting. And I would say that the most important thing is just to understand the way they think, just to see why they do things, why they do that type of sushi, why they love that food. It's something that really makes the whole experience something unique and different. And actually, that's the thing that later you can tell your friends, like, I know Japan, I don't, I know all the tourist place, but I know as well that little village nearby the sea where no one have ever been, just the local people. And I think that that's the magic of traveling and that's the magic of seeing different things.", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 8.0"}

When, when you go to a temple, I, I wear, like, pure simple clothes because that is the tradition. So, that, that makes me feel, like, really peaceful and calm because most of the time you wear, like, simple clothing when you go to a temple. So, it makes me feel calm when I wear those clothes. And during festivals, when I wear, like, those traditional Indian clothes, it makes me happy because it's, like, a festival I've been celebrating since I was a kid. So during Diwali and Holi and all. Yes, in Holi I wear, like, everyone wears white clothes because they throw colors on you. So you get, like, you go out with a white cloth and then when you come back it's, like, all colorful. So different clothes for different occasions I suppose. Here I have been wearing a lot of warm clothes and that makes me feel really warm. Yeah. And I, I buy clothes from, from different stores I suppose depending on what kind of clothes I want. And, um, so, yeah. And, uh, when I go for an interview I, I mostly dress in formals. So that makes me feel very confident and, and that I'm prepared.", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 7.5"}

And it was amazing because firstly, I met all my relatives that I haven't seen them for a long time.

That's always, always. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy much my relatives, as I explained before, because I lived in Milan, which is so far from Sicily, and the most beautiful thing I have is just the memory at the moment, remembering them, yes, birthday, yes, Christmas together, was a nice experience.", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 7.0"}

The biggest decision that I have to make was when I was studying medicine school. I studied that for four years and I changed, I decide to change to programming. It was a really stressful moment in my life, was not an easy decision. I have all my best friends in medicine school, I was doing quite good, in three years I think that I failed only one test. But I was not happy about when I started getting closer to the hospital, because the first three, four years you actually don't work in a hospital. So when I started getting closer to that, I started feeling that it was not something for me. And I also loved technology all my life, so I was in a moment where I need to decide what I want to do, if I need to continue in that way or change, and I decide to change. And it was not really an easy topic at all for me, for my family, for my friends. It was a really tough decision. It was not really, was really stressful and not a pleasant experience at that moment. I feel now, I feel really happy about my decision after years about that, but took me a while to actually feel confident that I did a good decision. Yes, for anyone like who wants, who is doubting between this, it could take you like some time but to realize if you did a great choice or not, but I feel that worths the price to take the risk and do.", "output": "Band score Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 7.0"}
